## 1. K-12 Mathematics Standards Architecture & Coding System

### 1.1 Understanding Louisiana Math Standard Codes

Every Louisiana mathematics standard follows a structured coding format that enables precise identification and alignment checking. The coding system varies between K-8 standards and high school courses.

**K-8 Standard Code Format**: `[GRADE].[DOMAIN].[CLUSTER].[STANDARD#]`

**Example**: `3.NBT.A.3`
- **3** = Grade 3
- **NBT** = Number and Operations in Base Ten (domain)
- **A** = First cluster within that domain
- **3** = Third standard within that cluster

**High School Standard Code Format**: `[COURSE]: [CONCEPTUAL_CATEGORY]-[DOMAIN].[CLUSTER].[STANDARD#]`

**Example**: `GM: G-SRT.B.5`
- **GM** = Geometry course
- **G** = Geometry conceptual category
- **SRT** = Similarity, Right Triangles, and Trigonometry (domain)
- **B** = Second cluster
- **5** = Fifth standard

**Course Abbreviations**:
- **A1** = Algebra I
- **GM** = Geometry
- **A2** = Algebra II

### 1.2 Development of K-12 Louisiana Student Standards for Mathematics

The Louisiana mathematics standards were created by over one hundred Louisiana educators with input by thousands of parents and teachers from across the state. Educators envisioned what mathematically proficient students should know and be able to do to compete in our society and focused their efforts on creating standards that would allow them to do so. The new standards provide appropriate content for all grades or courses, maintain high expectations, and create a logical connection of content across and within grades.

### 1.3 The Role of Standards in Establishing Key Student Skills and Mathematical Proficiency

Students in Louisiana are ready for college or a career if they are able to meet college and workplace expectations without needing remediation in mathematics skills and concepts. The standards define what Louisiana students should know, understand, and be able to do mathematically and represent the steps students must take along the way to be able to meet this goal.

For example, all students should be able to recall and use math skills and concepts on a daily basis. That is, a student should know certain math facts and concepts such as how to add, subtract, multiply, and divide basic numbers with ease, how to work with simple fractions and percentages, and how to apply basic algebra and geometry principles. Additionally, students need to be able to reason mathematically, communicate with others about math through speaking and writing, and problem solve in real-world situations to be prepared mathematically for post-secondary education or to pursue a career.

The K-12 mathematics standards lay the foundation that allows students to become mathematically proficient by focusing on conceptual understanding, procedural skill and fluency, and application.

**Conceptual Understanding** refers to understanding mathematical concepts, operations, and relations. It is more than knowing isolated facts and methods. Students should be able to make sense of why a mathematical idea is important and the kinds of contexts in which it is useful. It also allows students to connect prior knowledge to new ideas and concepts.

**Procedural Skill and Fluency** is the ability to apply procedures accurately, efficiently, and flexibly. It requires speed and accuracy in calculation while giving students opportunities to practice basic skills. Students' ability to solve more complex application tasks is dependent on procedural skill and fluency.

**Application** provides a valuable context for learning and the opportunity to solve problems in a relevant and a meaningful way. It is through real-world application that students learn to select an efficient method to find a solution, determine whether the solution(s) makes sense by reasoning, and develop critical thinking skills.

### 1.4 Structure of the Standards

There are two types of standards in the Louisiana Mathematics Standards:

1. **Standards for Mathematical Practice** - Apply to all grade levels and describe mathematically proficient students

2. **Standards for Mathematical Content** - K-8 standards are presented by grade level; high school standards are presented by course (Algebra I, Geometry, Algebra II), then organized by conceptual categories:
   - Number and Quantity
   - Algebra
   - Functions
   - Modeling
   - Geometry
   - Statistics and Probability

**Key Terminology** (from most specific to most general):

- **Standards** - Statements of what a student should know, understand, and be able to do
- **Clusters** - Groups of related standards. Cluster headings represent the big ideas that the group of standards address
- **Domains** - Large categories of mathematics that clusters and content standards delineate and address (e.g., Number and Operations – Fractions)
- **Conceptual Categories** - Very broad categories of mathematical thought used to organize high school course work (e.g., Algebra, Geometry, Functions)

### 1.5 Reading Standards and Interpreting their Codes in Grades K-8

Example from the Grade 3 standards:

There are four parts to the code for a mathematics standard in Kindergarten through Grade 8. The Cluster Headers are identified by an uppercase letter (A, B, C…). If a Domain has four clusters, then the letter A is assigned to the heading for the first cluster, B to the second, C to the third, and D to the fourth cluster. Each part of the code is separated by a period and has a specific meaning:

![](https://doe.louisiana.gov/docs/default-source/teacher-toolbox-resources/images/bfc1192a4898218a12c2bb046daeff61f5f5d0f8d254f8f0a3a96c5b78b7a99b.jpg)

Look at the example below. It is the code for the last Grade 3 standard in the above list.

# 3.NBT.A.3

The grade level is 3, the domain code is NBT (Numbers and Operations in Base Ten), the cluster is A (first cluster), and the standard number is 3. The text of standard 3.NBT.A.3 is provided below.

3.NBT.A.3. Multiply one-digit whole numbers by multiples of 10 in the range 10–90 (e.g., $9 \times 80$, $5 \times 60$) using strategies based on place value and properties of operations.

### 1.6 Reading Standards and Interpreting their Codes in High School Courses

The codes for standards in high school math courses have five parts. An excerpt of the standards for the high school Geometry course as displayed in this document is shown below.

![](https://doe.louisiana.gov/docs/default-source/teacher-toolbox-resources/images/b91ad11e8eb69ace44f963ad9f74722ea8def3129b81e1afe86d08bca8bd6fca.jpg)

As indicated in the excerpt, the abbreviation used for the high school Geometry course is GM. The abbreviations used for Algebra I and Algebra II are A1 and A2, respectively. The course name abbreviation is followed by abbreviations for the Conceptual Category and the Domain, the letter of the Cluster Header, and then the standard number. High school Conceptual Categories and their abbreviations are located in the table of the next section (Progressions).

The code for standard 5 in the list above is GM: G-SRT.B.5 with the meaning of each part noted in the graphic below.

![](https://doe.louisiana.gov/docs/default-source/teacher-toolbox-resources/images/e19eb6cb31aac19a37d40da901e9e791850986c38f3623e9a28739e83eca9551.jpg)

# Algebra I Example A1: N-Q.A.2

# Quantities

# A. Reason quantitatively and use units to solve problems.

1. Use units as a way to understand problems and to guide the solution of multi-step problems; choose and interpret units consistently in formulas; choose and interpret the scale and the origin in graphs and data displays.

2. Define appropriate quantities for the purpose of descriptive modeling. Choose a level of accuracy appropriate to limitations on measurement when reporting quantities.

# Algebra II Example A2: F-LE.B.4

# Linear, Quadratic, and Exponential Models★

A. Construct and compare linear, quadratic, and exponential models and solve problems.

4. For exponential models, express as a logarithm the solution to $ab^{ct} = d$ where $a$, $c$, and $d$ are numbers and the base $b$ is 2, 10, or $e$; evaluate the logarithm using technology.

B. Interpret expressions for functions in terms of the situation they model. Interpret the parameters in a linear, quadratic, or exponential function in terms of a context.

Note: There is not an error in the Algebra II listing of standards above. Standards 1 and 3 in the Linear, Quadratic, and Exponential Models domain are in the Algebra I standard with codes of A1: F-LE.A.1 and A1:F-LE.A.3.

### 1.7 Companion Documents for Teachers

Companion documents for teachers are designed to assist educators in interpreting and implementing the new Louisiana Student Standards for Mathematics by providing descriptions and examples for each standard in a grade level or course. The companion documents are linked in the Resources section and the grade level listings of this document.

### 1.8 Progressions in the Math Standards

The standards for each grade should not be considered a checklist or taught in isolation. There is a flow or progression that creates coherence within a grade and from one grade to the next. The progressions are organized using domains in grades K -8 and conceptual categories in high school. The color-coded table shows the domains, categories, and their abbreviations, and identifies the five progressions present in the Louisiana Student Standards for Mathematics. Each of the progressions begins in Kindergarten and indicates a constant movement toward the high school standards. Progressions guarantee a steady, age-appropriate development of each topic and also ensure that gaps are not created in the mathematical education of Louisiana’s students. The table is designed to allow teachers to see the coherence and connections among the mathematical topics in the standards.

## 2. Standards for Mathematical Practice

The Standards for Mathematical Practice describe varieties of expertise that mathematics educators at all levels should seek to develop in their students. These practices rest on important "processes and proficiencies" with longstanding importance in mathematics education.

The Standards for Mathematical Practice are typically developed as students solve high-level mathematical tasks that support approaches, practices, and habits of mind which are called for within these standards.

### 2.1 The Eight Standards for Mathematical Practice

Being successful in mathematics requires that development of approaches, practices, and habits of mind are implemented as one strives to develop mathematical fluency, procedural skills, and conceptual understanding. The Standards for Mathematical Practice describe varieties of expertise that mathematics educators at all levels should seek to develop in their students. These practices rest on important “processes and proficiencies” with longstanding importance in mathematics education.

The Standards for Mathematical Practice are typically developed as students solve high-level mathematical tasks that support approaches, practices, and habits of mind which are called for within these standards.

The following are the eight Standards for Mathematical Practice and their descriptions.

#### MP1: Make sense of problems and persevere in solving them

Mathematically proficient students start by explaining to themselves the meaning of a problem and looking for entry points to its solution. They analyze givens, constraints, relationships, and goals. They make conjectures about the form and meaning of the solution and plan a solution pathway rather than simply jumping into a solution attempt. They consider analogous problems, and try special cases and simpler forms of the original problem in order to gain insight into its solution. They monitor and evaluate their progress and change course if necessary. Older students might, depending on the context of the problem, transform algebraic expressions or change the viewing window on their graphing calculator to get the information they need. Mathematically proficient students can explain correspondences between equations, verbal descriptions, tables, and graphs or draw diagrams of important features and relationships, graph data, and search for regularity or trends. Younger students might rely on using concrete objects or pictures to help conceptualize and solve a problem. Mathematically proficient students check their answers to problems using a different method, and they continually ask themselves, “Does this make sense?” They can understand the approaches of others to solving complex problems and identify correspondences between different approaches.

#### MP2: Reason abstractly and quantitatively

Mathematically proficient students make sense of the quantities and their relationships in problem situations. Students bring two complementary abilities to bear on problems involving quantitative relationships: the ability to decontextualize—to abstract a given situation and represent it symbolically and manipulate the representing symbols as if they have a life of their own, without necessarily attending to their referents—and the ability to contextualize, to pause as needed during the manipulation process in order to probe into the referents for the symbols involved. Quantitative reasoning entails habits of creating a coherent representation of the problem at hand; considering the units involved; attending to the meaning of quantities, not just how to compute them; and knowing and flexibly using different properties of operations and objects.

#### MP3: Construct viable arguments and critique the reasoning of others

Mathematically proficient students understand and use stated assumptions, definitions, and previously established results in constructing arguments. They make conjectures and build a logical progression of statements to explore the truth of their conjectures. They are able to analyze situations by breaking them into cases, and can recognize and use counterexamples. They justify their conclusions, communicate them to others, and respond to the arguments of others. They reason inductively about data, making plausible arguments that take into account the context from which the data arose. Mathematically proficient students are also able to compare the effectiveness of two plausible arguments, distinguish correct logic or reasoning from that which is flawed, and—if there is a flaw in an argument—explain what it is. Elementary students can construct arguments using concrete referents such as objects, drawings, diagrams, and actions. Such arguments can make sense and be correct, even though they are not generalized or made formal until later grades. Later, students learn to

determine domains to which an argument applies. Students at all grades can listen or read the arguments of others, decide whether they make sense, and ask useful questions to clarify or improve the arguments.

#### MP4: Model with mathematics

Mathematically proficient students can apply the mathematics they know to solve problems arising in everyday life, society, and the workplace. In early grades, this might be as simple as writing an addition equation to describe a situation. In middle grades, a student might apply proportional reasoning to plan a school event or analyze a problem in the community. By high school, a student might use geometry to solve a design problem or use a function to describe how one quantity of interest depends on another. Mathematically proficient students who can apply what they know are comfortable making assumptions and approximations to simplify a complicated situation, realizing that these may need revision later. They are able to identify important quantities in a practical situation and map their relationships using such tools as diagrams, two-way tables, graphs, flowcharts and formulas. They can analyze those relationships mathematically to draw conclusions. They routinely interpret their mathematical results in the context of the situation and reflect on whether the results make sense, possibly improving the model if it has not served its purpose.

#### MP5: Use appropriate tools strategically

Mathematically proficient students consider the available tools when solving a mathematical problem. These tools might include pencil and paper, concrete models, a ruler, a protractor, a calculator, a spreadsheet, a computer algebra system, a statistical package, or dynamic geometry software. Proficient students are sufficiently familiar with tools appropriate for their grade or course to make sound decisions about when each of these tools might be helpful, recognizing both the insight to be gained and their limitations. For example, mathematically proficient high school students analyze graphs of functions and solutions generated using a graphing calculator. They detect possible errors by strategically using estimation and other mathematical knowledge. When making mathematical models, they know that technology can enable them to visualize the results of varying assumptions, explore consequences, and compare predictions with data. Mathematically proficient students at various grade levels are able to identify relevant external mathematical resources, such as digital content located on a website, and use them to pose or solve problems. They are able to use technologica tools to explore and deepen their understanding of concepts.

#### MP6: Attend to precision

Mathematically proficient students try to communicate precisely to others. They try to use clear definitions in discussion with others and in their own reasoning. They state the meaning of the symbols they choose, including using the equal sign consistently and appropriately. They are careful about specifying units of measure, and labeling axes to clarify the correspondence with quantities in a problem. They calculate accurately and efficiently, express numerical answers with a degree of precision appropriate for the problem context. In the elementary grades, students give carefully formulated explanations to each other. By the time they reach high school they have learned to examine claims and make explicit use of definitions.

#### MP7: Look for and make use of structure

Mathematically proficient students look closely to discern a pattern or structure. Young students, for example, might notice that three and seven more is the same amount as seven and three more, or they may sort a collection of shapes according to how many sides the shapes have. Later, students will see $7 \\times 8$ equals the wellremembered $7 \\times 5 + 7 \\times 3$ , in preparation for learning about the distributive property. In the expression $x ^ { 2 } + 9 x +$ 14, older students can see the 14 as $2 \\times 7$ and the 9 as $^ 2 + 7$ . They recognize the significance of an existing line in a geometric figure and can use the strategy of drawing an auxiliary line for solving problems. They also can step back for an overview and shift perspective. They can see complicated things, such as some algebraic expressions, as single objects or as being composed of several objects. For example, they can see $5 - 3 ( x - y ) ^ { 2 }$ as

5 minus a positive number times a square and use that to realize that its value cannot be more than 5 for any real numbers x and y.

#### MP8: Look for and express regularity in repeated reasoning

Mathematically proficient students notice if calculations are repeated, and look both for general methods and for shortcuts. Upper elementary students might notice when dividing 25 by 11 that they are repeating the same calculations over and over again, and conclude they have a repeating decimal. By paying attention to the calculation of slope as they repeatedly check whether points are on the line through (1, 2) with slope 3, middle school students might abstract the equation $( y - 2 ) / ( x - 1 ) = 3 .$ . Noticing the regularity in the way terms cancel when expanding $( x - 1 ) ( x + 1 ) , ( x - 1 ) ( x ^ { 2 } + x + 1 )$ , and $( x - 1 ) ( x ^ { 3 } + x ^ { 2 } + x + 1 )$ might lead them to the general formula for the sum of a geometric series. As they work to solve a problem, mathematically proficient students maintain oversight of the process, while attending to the details. They continually evaluate the reasonableness of their intermediate results.

### 2.2 Connecting the Standards for Mathematical Practice to the Standards for Mathematical Content

The Standards for Mathematical Practice describe ways in which developing student practitioners of the discipline of mathematics increasingly ought to engage with the subject matter as they grow in mathematical maturity and expertise throughout the elementary, middle and high school years.

The Standards for Mathematical Content are a balanced combination of procedure and understanding. Expectations that begin with the word “understand” are often especially good opportunities to connect the practices to the content. Students who lack understanding of a topic may rely on procedures too heavily. Without a flexible base from which to work, they may be less likely to consider analogous problems, represent problems coherently, justify conclusions, apply the mathematics to practical situations, use technology mindfully to work with the mathematics, explain the mathematics accurately to other students, step back for an overview, or deviate from a known procedure to find a shortcut. In short, a lack of understanding effectively prevents a student from engaging in the mathematical practices.

In this respect, those content standards which set an expectation of understanding are potential “points of intersection” between the Standards for Mathematical Content and the Standards for Mathematical Practice. These points of intersection are intended to be weighted toward central and generative concepts in the school mathematics curriculum that most merit the time, resources, innovative energies, and focus necessary to qualitatively improve the curriculum, instruction, assessment, professional development, and student achievement in mathematics.

## 3. Standards for Mathematical Content by Grade Level

### 3.1 Kindergarten


# Grade Level Overview

(1) Students use numbers, including written numerals, to represent quantities and to solve quantitative problems, such as counting objects in a set; counting out a given number of objects; comparing sets or numerals; and modeling simple joining and separating situations with sets of objects, or eventually with equations such as $5 + 2 = 7$ and $7 - 2 =$ 5. (Kindergarten students should see addition and subtraction equations, and student writing of equations in Kindergarten is encouraged, but it is not required.) Students choose, combine, and apply effective strategies for answering quantitative questions, including quickly recognizing the cardinalities of small sets of objects, counting and producing sets of given sizes, counting the number of objects in combined sets, or counting the number of objects that remain in a set after some are taken away.

(2) Students describe their physical world using geometric ideas (e.g., shape, orientation, spatial relations) and vocabulary. They identify, name, and describe basic two-dimensional shapes, such as squares, triangles, circles, rectangles, and hexagons, presented in a variety of ways (e.g., with different sizes and orientations), as well as threedimensional shapes such as cubes, cones, cylinders, and spheres. They use basic shapes and spatial reasoning to model objects in their environment and to construct more complex shapes.

# Counting and Cardinality

# A. Know number names and the count sequence.

1. Count to 100 by ones and by tens.

2. Count forward beginning from a given number within the known sequence (instead of having to begin at 1). 3. Write numbers from 0 to 20. Represent a number of objects with a written numeral 0–20 (with 0 representing a count of no objects).

1. Represent addition and subtraction with objects, fingers, mental images, drawings2, sounds (e.g., claps), acting out situations, verbal explanations, expressions, or equations.
2. Solve addition and subtraction word problems, and add and subtract within 10, e.g., by using objects or drawings to represent the problem.
3. Decompose numbers less than or equal to 10 into pairs in more than one way, e.g., by using objects or drawings, and record each decomposition by a drawing or equation (e.g., $5 = 2 + 3$ and $5 = 4 + 1$ ).
4. For any number from 1 to 9, find the number that makes 10 when added to the given number, e.g., by using objects or drawings, and record the answer with a drawing or equation. Fluently add and subtract within 5.

# Number and Operations in Base Ten

# A. Work with numbers 11–19 to gain foundations for place value.

1. Gain understanding of place value.

a. Understand that the numbers 11–19 are composed of ten ones and one, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, or nine ones.

b. Compose and decompose numbers 11 to 19 using place value (e.g., by using objects or drawings).

c. Record each composition or decomposition using a drawing or equation (e.g., 18 is one ten and eight ones, $ 1 8 = 1$ ten $^ { + 8 }$ ones, $1 8 = 1 0 + 8 )$ .

# Measurement and Data

# A. Describe and compare measurable attributes.

1. Describe measurable attributes of objects, such as length or weight. Describe several measurable attributes of a single object.

2. Directly compare two objects with a measurable attribute in common, to see which object has “more of”/“less of” the attribute, and describe the difference. For example, directly compare the heights of two children and describe one child as taller/shorter.

# Geometry

A. Identify and describe shapes (squares, circles, triangles, rectangles, hexagons, cubes, cones, cylinders, and spheres).

1. Describe objects in the environment using names of shapes, and describe the relative positions of these objects using terms such as above, below, beside, in front of, behind, and next to.

2. Correctly name shapes regardless of their orientations or overall size.

3. Identify shapes as two-dimensional (lying in a plane, “flat”) or three-dimensional (“solid”).


# B. Analyze, compare, create, and compose shapes.

4. Analyze and compare two- and three-dimensional shapes, in different sizes and orientations, using informal language to describe their similarities, differences, parts (e.g., number of sides and vertices/“corners”) and other attributes (e.g., having sides of equal length).

5. Model shapes in the world by building shapes from components (e.g., sticks and clay balls) and drawing shapes. 6. Compose simple shapes to form larger shapes. For example, "Can you join these two triangles with full sides touching to make a rectangle?


### 3.2 Grade 1


# Grade Level Overview

(1) Students develop strategies for adding and subtracting whole numbers based on their prior work with small numbers. They use a variety of models, including discrete objects and length-based models (e.g., cubes connected to form lengths), to model add-to, take-from, put-together, take-apart, and compare situations to develop meaning for the operations of addition and subtraction, and to develop strategies to solve arithmetic problems with these operations. Students understand connections between counting and addition and subtraction (e.g., adding two is the same as counting on two). They use properties of addition to add whole numbers and to create and use increasingly sophisticated strategies based on these properties (e.g., “making tens”) to solve addition and subtraction problems within 20. By comparing a variety of solution strategies, children build their understanding of the relationship between addition and subtraction.

(2) Students develop, discuss, and use efficient, accurate, and generalizable methods to add within 100 and subtract multiples of 10. They compare whole numbers (at least to 100) to develop understanding of and solve problems involving their relative sizes. They think of whole numbers between 10 and 100 in terms of tens and ones (especially recognizing the numbers 11 to 19 as composed of a ten and some ones). Through activities that build number sense, they understand the order of the counting numbers and their relative magnitudes.

(3) Students develop an understanding of the meaning and processes of measurement, including underlying concepts such as iterating (the mental activity of building up the length of an object with equal-sized units) and the transitivity principle for indirect measurement.1

(4) Students compose and decompose plane or solid figures (e.g., put two triangles together to make a quadrilateral) and build understanding of part-whole relationships as well as the properties of the original and composite shapes. As they combine shapes, they recognize them from different perspectives and orientations, describe their geometric attributes, and determine how they are alike and different, to develop the background for measurement and for initial understandings of properties such as congruence and symmetry.

# Operations and Algebraic Thinking

# A. Represent and solve problems involving addition and subtraction.

1. Use addition and subtraction within 20 to solve word problems involving situations of adding to, taking from, putting together, taking apart, and comparing, with unknowns in all positions (e.g., by using objects, drawings, and equations with a symbol for the unknown number to represent the problem).2

2. Solve word problems that call for addition of three whole numbers whose sum is less than or equal to 20, e.g., by using objects, drawings, and equations with a symbol for the unknown number to represent the problem.


# B. Understand and apply properties of operations and the relationship between addition and subtraction.

3. Apply properties of operations to add and subtract.3 Examples: If $8 + 3 = 1 1$ is known, then $3 + 8 = 1 1$ is also known. (Commutative property of addition.) To add $2 + 6 + 4 ,$ , the second two numbers can be added to make a ten, so $2 + 6 + 4 = 2 + 1 0 = 1 2$ . (Associative property of addition.)

4. Understand subtraction as an unknown-addend problem. For example, subtract 10 – 8 by finding the number that makes 10 when added to 8.


# C. Add and subtract within 20.

5. Relate counting to addition and subtraction (e.g., by counting on 2 to add 2).

6. Add and subtract within 20, demonstrating fluency for addition and subtraction within 10. Use mental strategies such as counting on; making ten (e.g., $8 + 6 = 8 + 2 + 4 = 1 0 + 4 = 1 4$ ); decomposing a number leading to a ten (e.g., $1 3 - 4 = 1 3 - 3 - 1 = 1 0 - 1 = 9 )$ ; using the relationship between addition and subtraction (e.g., knowing that $8 + 4 = 1 2$ , one knows $1 2 - 8 = 4 )$ ; and creating equivalent but easier or known sums (e.g., adding $6 + 7$ by creating the known equivalent $6 + 6 + 1 = 1 2 + 1 = 1 3$ ).


# D. Work with addition and subtraction equations.

7. Understand the meaning of the equal sign, and determine if equations involving addition and subtraction are true or false. For example, which of the following equations are true and which are false? $6 = 6 ,$ $7 = 8 - 1 \\qquad $ , $5 + 2 =$ $2 + 5 ,$ $4 + 1 = 5 + 2$ .

8. Determine the unknown whole number in an addition or subtraction equation relating three whole numbers. For example, determine the unknown number that makes the equation true in each of the equations $8 + ? = 1 1 ,$ , 5 =  – 3, $6 + 6 = \\square$ .


# Number and Operations in Base Ten

# A. Extend the counting sequence.

1. Count to 120, starting at any number less than 120. In this range, read and write numerals and represent a number of objects with a written numeral.

# B. Understand place value.

2. Understand that the two digits of a two-digit number represent amounts of tens and ones. Understand the following as special cases:

### 3.4 Grade 3


# Grade Level Overview

(1) Students develop an understanding of the meanings of multiplication and division of whole numbers through activities and problems involving equal-sized groups, arrays, and area models; multiplication is finding an unknown product, and division is finding an unknown factor in these situations. For equal-sized group situations, division can require finding the unknown number of groups or the unknown group size. Students use properties of operations to calculate products of whole numbers, using increasingly sophisticated strategies based on these properties to solve multiplication and division problems involving single-digit factors. By comparing a variety of solution strategies, students learn the relationship between multiplication and division.

(2) Students develop an understanding of fractions, beginning with unit fractions. Students view fractions in general as being built out of unit fractions, and they use fractions along with visual fraction models to represent parts of a whole. Students understand that the size of a fractional part is relative to the size of the whole. For example, ${ } ^ { 1 / 2 }$ of the paint in a small bucket could be less paint than $1 / 3$ of the paint in a larger bucket, but $1 / 3$ of a ribbon is longer than $^ 1 / 5$ of the same ribbon because when the ribbon is divided into 3 equal parts, the parts are longer than when the ribbon is divided into 5 equal parts. Students are able to use fractions to represent numbers equal to, less than, and greater than one. They solve problems that involve comparing fractions by using visual fraction models and strategies based on noticing equal numerators or denominators.

(3) Students recognize area as an attribute of two-dimensional regions. They measure the area of a shape by finding the total number of same-size units of area required to cover the shape without gaps or overlaps, a square with sides of unit length being the standard unit for measuring area. Students understand that rectangular arrays can be decomposed into identical rows or into identical columns. By decomposing rectangles into rectangular arrays of squares, students connect area to multiplication, and justify using multiplication to determine the area of a rectangle.

(4) Students describe, analyze, and compare properties of two-dimensional shapes. They compare and classify shapes by their sides and angles, and connect these with definitions of shapes. Students also relate their fraction work to geometry by expressing the area of part of a shape as a unit fraction of the whole.

Interpret whole-number quotients of whole numbers, e.g., interpret $5 6 \\div 8$ as the number of objects in each share when 56 objects are partitioned equally into 8 shares, or as a number of shares when 56 objects are partitioned into equal shares of 8 objects each. For example, describe a context in which a number of shares or a number of groups can be expressed as $5 6 \\div 8$ .

3. Use multiplication and division within 100 to solve word problems in situations involving equal groups, arrays, and measurement quantities, e.g., by using drawings and equations with a symbol for the unknown number to represent the problem.1

4. Determine the unknown whole number in a multiplication or division equation relating three whole numbers. For example, determine the unknown number that makes the equation true in each of the equations $8 \\times ? = 4 8 ,$ 5 $= \\boxed { \ } \\div 3 ,$ , $6 \\times 6 = ?$ .


# B. Understand properties of multiplication and the relationship between multiplication and division.

5. Apply properties of operations as strategies to multiply and divide.2 Examples: If $6 \\times 4 = 2 4$ is known, then $4 \\times 6 =$ 24 is also known. (Commutative property of multiplication.) $3 \\times 5 \\times 2$ can be found by $3 \\times 5 = 1 5 ,$ then ${ \ : } 1 5 \\times 2 =$ 30, or by $5 \\times 2 = 1 0 ,$ then $3 \\times 1 0 = 3 0 .$ . (Associative property of multiplication.) Knowing that $8 \\times 5 = 4 0$ and $8 \\times 2$ $= \\mathcal { 1 6 } ,$ one can find $8 \\times 7 a s 8 \\times ( 5 + 2 ) = ( 8 \\times 5 ) + ( 8 \\times 2 ) = 4 0 + 1 6 = 5 6 .$ . (Distributive property.)

6. Understand division as an unknown-factor problem. For example, find $3 2 \\div 8$ by finding the number that makes 32 when multiplied by 8.


# C. Multiply and divide within 100.

7. Fluently multiply and divide within 100, using strategies such as the relationship between multiplication and division (e.g., knowing that $8 \\times 5 = 4 0$ , one knows $4 0 \\div 5 = 8 \\cdots$ ) or properties of operations. By the end of Grade 3, know from memory all products of two one-digit numbers.

D. Solve problems involving the four operations, and identify and explain patterns in arithmetic.

5. Express a fraction with denominator 10 as an equivalent fraction with denominator 100, and use this technique to add two fractions with respective denominators 10 and 100.2 For example, express 3/10 as 30/100, and add $3 / 1 0 + 4 / 1 0 0 = 3 4 / 1 0 0 .$ .

6. Use decimal notation for fractions with denominators 10 or 100. For example, rewrite 0.62 as 62/100; describe length as 0.62 meters; locate 0.62 on a number line diagram; represent 62/100 of a dollar as $$ 0.62$ .

7. Compare two decimals to hundredths by reasoning about their size. Recognize that comparisons are valid only when the two decimals refer to the same whole. Record the results of comparisons with the symbols >, =, or $\\mathbf { < } ,$ and justify the conclusions, e.g., by using a visual model.


# Measurement and Data

# A. Solve problems involving measurement and conversion of measurements from a larger unit to a smaller unit.

1. Know relative sizes of measurement units within one system of units including ft, in; km, m, cm; kg, g; lb, oz.; l, ml; hr, min, sec. Within a single system of measurement, express measurements in a larger unit in terms of a smaller unit. Record measurement equivalents in a two-column table. (Conversions are limited to one-step conversions.) For example, know that 1 ft is 12 times as long as 1 in. Express the length of a 4 ft snake as 48 in. Generate a conversion table for feet and inches listing the number pairs (1, 12), (2, 24), (3, 36), …

2. Use the four operations to solve word problems involving distances, intervals of time, liquid volumes, masses of objects, and money, including problems involving whole numbers and/or simple fractions (addition and subtraction of fractions with like denominators and multiplying a fraction times a fraction3 or a whole number), and problems that require expressing measurements given in a larger unit in terms of a smaller unit. Represent measurement quantities using diagrams such as number line diagrams that feature a measurement scale.

3. Apply the area and perimeter formulas for rectangles in real-world and mathematical problems. For example, find the width of a rectangular room given the area of the flooring and the length, by viewing the area formula as a multiplication equation with an unknown factor.

4. Make a line plot to display a data set of measurements in fractions of a unit $( ^ { 1 } / 2 , ^ { 1 } / 4 , ^ { 1 } / 8 )$ . Solve problems involving addition and subtraction of fractions by using information presented in line plots. For example, from a line plot find and interpret the difference in length between the longest and shortest specimens in an insect collection.

# C. Geometric measurement: understand concepts of angle and measure angles.

5. Recognize angles as geometric shapes that are formed wherever two rays share a common endpoint, and understand concepts of angle measurement:

a. An angle is measured with reference to a circle with its center at the common endpoint of the rays, by considering the fraction of the circular arc between the points where two rays intersect the circle. b. An angle that turns through 1/360 of a circle is called a "one-degree angle," and can be used to measure angles. c. An angle that turns through n one-degree angles is said to have an angle measure of n degrees.

6. Measure angles in whole-number degrees using a protractor. Sketch angles of specified measure.

7. Recognize angle measure as additive. When an angle is decomposed into non-overlapping parts, the angle measure of the whole is the sum of the angle measures of the parts. Solve addition and subtraction problems to find unknown angles on a diagram in real-world and mathematical problems, e.g., by using an equation with a letter for the unknown angle measure.


# D. Relate area to operations of multiplication and addition.

8. Recognize area as additive. Find areas of rectilinear figures by decomposing them into non-overlapping rectangles and adding the areas of the non-overlapping parts, applying this technique to solve real-world problems.

3. Interpret a fraction as division of the numerator by the denominator $( a / b = a \\div b )$ . Solve word problems involving division of whole numbers leading to answers in the form of fractions or mixed numbers, e.g., by using visual fraction models or equations to represent the problem. For example, interpret $3 / \_ { 4 }$ as the result of dividing 3 by 4, noting that $3 / \_ { 4 }$ multiplied by 4 equals 3, and that when 3 wholes are shared equally among 4 people each person has a share of size $3 / 4 .$ . If 9 people want to share a 50-pound sack of rice equally by weight, how many pounds of rice should each person get? Between what two whole numbers does your answer lie?

4. Apply and extend previous understandings of multiplication to multiply a fraction or whole number by a fraction.

7. Apply and extend previous understandings of division to divide unit fractions by whole numbers and whole numbers by unit fractions.1 a. Interpret division of a unit fraction by a non-zero whole number, and compute such quotients. For example, create a story context for $( 1 / 3 ) \\div 4 ,$ and use a visual fraction model to show the quotient. Use the relationship between multiplication and division to explain that $( 1 / 3 ) \\div 4 = 1 / 1 2$ because $( 1 / 1 2 ) \\times 4 = 1 / 3$ . b. Interpret division of a whole number by a unit fraction, and compute such quotients. For example, create $\\pmb { q }$ story context for $4 \\div ( 1 / 5 ) ,$ , and use a visual fraction model to show the quotient. Use the relationship between multiplication and division to explain that $4 \\div ( 1 / 5 ) = 2 0$ because $2 0 \\times ( 1 / 5 ) = 4$ . c. Solve real-world problems involving division of unit fractions by non-zero whole numbers and division of whole numbers by unit fractions, e.g., by using visual fraction models and equations to represent the problem.

# Measurement and Data

# A. Convert like measurement units within a given measurement system.

1. Convert among different-sized standard measurement units within a given measurement system, and use these conversions in solving multi-step, real-world problems (e.g., convert 5 cm to $0 . 0 5 ~ \\mathsf { m }$ ; 9 ft to 108 in).

# B. Represent and interpret data.

2. Make a line plot to display a data set of measurements in fractions of a unit $( ^ { 1 } / 2 , ^ { 1 } / 4 , ^ { 1 } / 8 )$ .

1. Use a pair of perpendicular number lines, called axes, to define a coordinate system, with the intersection of the lines (the origin) arranged to coincide with the 0 on each line and a given point in the plane located by using an ordered pair of numbers, called its coordinates. Understand that the first number in the ordered pair indicates how far to travel from the origin in the direction of one axis, and the second number in the ordered pair indicates how far to travel in the direction of the second axis, with the convention that the names of the two axes and the coordinates correspond (e.g., $x \\cdot$ -axis and $x \\cdot$ -coordinate, y-axis and y-coordinate).

2. Represent real-world and mathematical problems by graphing points in the first quadrant of the coordinate plane, and interpret coordinate values of points in the context of the situation.


# B. Classify two-dimensional figures into categories based on their properties.

3. Understand that attributes belonging to a category of two-dimensional figures also belong to all subcategories of that category. For example, all rectangles have four right angles and squares are rectangles, so all squares have four right angles.

4. Classify quadrilaterals in a hierarchy based on properties. (Students will define a trapezoid as a quadrilateral with at least one pair of parallel sides.)


### 3.7 Grade 6


# Grade Level Overview

(1) Students use reasoning about multiplication and division to solve ratio and rate problems about quantities. By viewing equivalent ratios and rates as deriving from, and extending, pairs of rows (or columns) in the multiplication table, and by analyzing simple drawings that indicate the relative size of quantities, students connect their understanding of multiplication and division with ratios and rates. Thus students expand the scope of problems for which they can use multiplication and division to solve problems, and they connect ratios and fractions. Students solve a wide variety of problems involving ratios and rates.

(2) Students use the meaning of fractions, the meanings of multiplication and division, and the relationship between multiplication and division to understand and explain why the procedures for dividing fractions make sense. Students use these operations to solve problems. Students extend their previous understandings of number and the ordering of numbers to the full system of rational numbers, which includes negative rational numbers, and in particular negative integers. They reason about the order and absolute value of rational numbers and about the location of points in all four quadrants of the coordinate plane.

(3) Students understand the use of variables in mathematical expressions. They write expressions and equations that correspond to given situations, evaluate expressions, and use expressions and formulas to solve problems. Students understand that expressions in different forms can be equivalent, and they use the properties of operations to rewrite expressions in equivalent forms. Students know that the solutions of an equation are the values of the variables that make the equation true. Students use properties of operations and the idea of maintaining the equality of both sides of an equation to solve simple one-step equations. Students construct and analyze tables, such as tables of quantities that are in equivalent ratios, and they use equations (such as $3 x = y )$ ) to describe relationships between quantities.

(4) Building on and reinforcing their understanding of number, students begin to develop their ability to think statistically. Students recognize that a data distribution may not have a definite center and that different ways to measure center yield different values. The median measures center in the sense that it is roughly the middle value. The mean measures center in the sense that it is the value that each data point would take on if the total of the data values were redistributed equally, and also in the sense that it is a balance point. Students recognize that a measure of variability (interquartile range or mean absolute deviation) can also be useful for summarizing data because two very different sets of data can have the same mean and median yet be distinguished by their variability. Students learn to describe and summarize numerical data sets, identifying clusters, peaks, gaps, and symmetry, considering the context in which the data were collected.

Students in Grade 6 also build on their work with area in elementary school by reasoning about relationships among shapes to determine area, surface area, and volume. They find areas of right triangles, other triangles, and special quadrilaterals by decomposing these shapes, rearranging or removing pieces, and relating the shapes to rectangles. Using these methods, students discuss, develop, and justify formulas for areas of triangles and parallelograms. Students find areas of polygons and surface areas of prisms and pyramids by decomposing them into pieces whose area they can determine. They reason about right rectangular prisms with fractional side lengths to extend formulas for the volume of a right rectangular prism to fractional side lengths. They prepare for work on scale drawings and constructions in Grade 7 by drawing polygons in the coordinate plane.

# Ratios and Proportional Relationships

# A. Understand ratio concepts and use ratio reasoning to solve problems.

1. Understand the concept of a ratio and use ratio language to describe a ratio relationship between two quantities. For example, “The ratio of wings to beaks in the bird house at the zoo was 2:1, because for every 2 wings there was 1 beak.” “For every vote candidate A received, candidate C received nearly three votes.”

2. Understand the concept of a unit rate $a / b$ associated with a ratio $a { : } b$ with $b \\neq 0$ , and use rate language in the context of a ratio relationship. For example, “This recipe has a ratio of 3 cups of flour to 4 cups of sugar, so there is 3/4 cup of flour for each cup of sugar.” “We paid $$ 75$ for 15 hamburgers, which is a rate of $$ 5$ per hamburger.” 1

3. Use ratio and rate reasoning to solve real-world and mathematical problems, e.g., by reasoning about tables of equivalent ratios, tape diagrams, double number line diagrams, or equations.


a. Make tables of equivalent ratios relating quantities with whole-number measurements, find missing value in the tables, and plot the pairs of values on the coordinate plane. Use tables to compare ratios.

b. Solve unit rate problems including those involving unit pricing and constant speed. For example, if it took 7 hours to mow 4 lawns, then at that rate, how many lawns could be mowed in 35 hours? At what unit rate were lawns being mowed?

c. Find a percent of a quantity as a rate per 100 (e.g., $30 %$ of a quantity means $3 0 / 1 0 0$ times the quantity); solve problems involving finding the whole, given a part and the percent.

d. Use ratio reasoning to convert measurement units; manipulate and transform units appropriately when multiplying or dividing quantities.

# The Number System

# A. Apply and extend previous understandings of multiplication and division to divide fractions by fractions.

1. Interpret and compute quotients of fractions, and solve word problems involving division of fractions by fractions, e.g., by using visual fraction models and equations to represent the problem. For example, create a story context for $( 2 / 3 ) \\div ( 3 / 4 )$ and use a visual fraction model to show the quotient; use the relationship between multiplication and division to explain that $( 2 / 3 ) \\div ( 3 / 4 ) = 8 / 9$ because $3 / 4$ of 8/9 is $2 / 3 .$ . (In general, $( a / b ) \\div ( c / d ) =$ $a d / b c .$ ) How much chocolate will each person get if 3 people share $\\imath \_ { / 2 }$ lb of chocolate equally? How many $3 / 4 \\AA$ - cup servings are in $2 / 3$ of a cup of yogurt? How wide is a rectangular strip of land with length $3 / 4$ mi and area 1/2 square mi?

# B. Compute fluently with multi-digit numbers and find common factors and multiples.

2. Fluently divide multi-digit numbers using the standard algorithm.

4. Find the greatest common factor of two whole numbers less than or equal to 100 and the least common multiple of two whole numbers less than or equal to 12. Use the distributive property to express a sum of two whole numbers 1–100 with a common factor as a multiple of a sum of two whole numbers with no common factor. For example, express $36 + 8$ as $4(9 + 2)$.

# C. Apply and extend previous understandings of numbers to the system of rational numbers.

5. Understand that positive and negative numbers are used together to describe quantities having opposite directions or values (e.g., temperature above/below zero, elevation above/below sea level, credits/debits, positive/negative electric charge); use positive and negative numbers to represent quantities in real-world contexts, explaining the meaning of 0 in each situation.

6. Understand a rational number as a point on the number line. Extend number line diagrams and coordinate axes familiar from previous grades to represent points on the line and in the plane with negative number coordinates.


a. Recognize opposite signs of numbers as indicating locations on opposite sides of 0 on the number line; recognize that the opposite of the opposite of a number is the number itself, e.g., $- ( - 3 ) = 3$ , and that 0 is its own opposite.

b. Understand signs of numbers in ordered pairs as indicating locations in quadrants of the coordinate plane; recognize that when two ordered pairs differ only by signs, the locations of the points are related by reflections across one or both axes.

c. Find and position integers and other rational numbers on a horizontal or vertical number line diagram; find and position pairs of integers and other rational numbers on a coordinate plane.

7. Understand ordering and absolute value of rational numbers.

a. Interpret statements of inequality as statements about the relative position of two numbers on a number line diagram. For example, interpret $^ { - 3 > - 7 }$ as a statement that $^ { - 3 }$ is located to the right of –7 on a number line oriented from left to right.

b. Write, interpret, and explain statements of order for rational numbers in real-world contexts. For example, write $- 3 ^ { \\circ } C > - 7 ^ { \\circ } C$ to express the fact that ${ } - 3 ^ { o } C$ is warmer than $- 7 ^ { o } C .$

c. Understand the absolute value of a rational number as its distance from 0 on the number line; interpret absolute value as magnitude for a positive or negative quantity in a real-world situation. For example, for an account balance of –30 dollars, write $\\left\| - 3 0 \\right\| = 3 0$ to describe the size of the debt in dollars.

d. Distinguish comparisons of absolute value from statements about order. For example, recognize that an account balance less than $\\mathtt { - 3 0 }$ dollars represents a debt greater than 30 dollars.

8. Solve real-world and mathematical problems by graphing points in all four quadrants of the coordinate plane. Include use of coordinates and absolute value to find distances between points with the same first coordinate or the same second coordinate.

# Expressions and Equations

# A. Apply and extend previous understandings of arithmetic to algebraic expressions.

1. Write and evaluate numerical expressions involving whole-number exponents.

2. Write, read, and evaluate expressions in which letters stand for numbers.


a. Write expressions that record operations with numbers and with letters standing for numbers. For example, express the calculation “Subtract y from $5 ^ { \\prime \\prime } a s 5 - y .$ .

b. Identify parts of an expression using mathematical terms (sum, term, product, factor, quotient, coefficient); view one or more parts of an expression as a single entity. For example, describe the expression 2 $( 8 + 7 )$ as a product of two factors; view $( 8 + 7 )$ as both a single entity and a sum of two terms.

c. Evaluate expressions at specific values of their variables. Include expressions that arise from formulas used in real-world problems. Perform arithmetic operations, including those involving whole-number exponents, in the conventional order when there are no parentheses to specify a particular order (Order of Operations). For example, use the formulas $V = s ^ { 3 }$ and $A = 6 s ^ { 2 }$ to find the volume and surface area of a cube with sides of length $s = 1 / 2$ .

3. Apply the properties of operations to generate equivalent expressions. For example, apply the distributive property to the expression $3 ( 2 + x )$ to produce the equivalent expression $6 + 3 x ;$ ; apply the distributive property to the expression $2 4 x + 1 8 y$ to produce the equivalent expression $6 \\left( 4 x + 3 y \\right)$ ; apply properties of operations to $y + y$ + y to produce the equivalent expression 3y.

4. Identify when two expressions are equivalent (i.e., when the two expressions name the same number regardless of which value is substituted into them). For example, the expressions $y + y + y$ and 3y are equivalent because they name the same number regardless of which number y stands for.


# B. Reason about and solve one-variable equations and inequalities.

5. Understand solving an equation or inequality as a process of answering a question: which values from a specified set, if any, make the equation or inequality true? Use substitution to determine whether a given number in a specified set makes an equation or inequality true.

6. Use variables to represent numbers and write expressions when solving a real-world or mathematical problem; understand that a variable can represent an unknown number, or, depending on the purpose at hand, any number in a specified set.

7. Solve real-world and mathematical problems by writing and solving equations and inequalities of the form $x + p$ $= q$ and $p x = q$ for cases in which $p , q$ and $x$ are all nonnegative rational numbers. Inequalities will include $< , > , \\leq ,$ and $\\geq$ .

8. Write an inequality of the form $x > c$ or $x < c$ to represent a constraint or condition in a real-world or mathematical problem. Recognize that inequalities of the form $x > c$ or $x < c$ have infinitely many solutions; represent solutions of such inequalities on number line diagrams.


# C. Represent and analyze quantitative relationships between dependent and independent variables.

9. Use variables to represent two quantities in a real-world problem that change in relationship to one another; write an equation to express one quantity, thought of as the dependent variable, in terms of the other quantity, thought of as the independent variable. Analyze the relationship between the dependent and independent variables using graphs and tables, and relate these to the equation. For example, in a problem involving motion at constant speed, list and graph ordered pairs of distances and times, and write the equation $d = 6 5 t$ to represent the relationship between distance and time.

# Geometry

# A. Solve real-world and mathematical problems involving area, surface area, and volume.

1. Find the area of right triangles, other triangles, special quadrilaterals, and polygons by composing into rectangles or decomposing into triangles and other shapes; apply these techniques in the context of solving realworld and mathematical problems.

2. Find the volume of a right rectangular prism with fractional edge lengths by packing it with unit cubes of the appropriate unit fraction edge lengths, and show that the volume is the same as would be found by multiplying the edge lengths of the prism. Apply the formulas $V = I w h$ and $V = B h$ to find volumes of right rectangular prisms with fractional edge lengths in the context of solving real-world and mathematical problems.

3. Draw polygons in the coordinate plane given coordinates for the vertices; use coordinates to find the length of a side joining points with the same first coordinate or the same second coordinate. Apply these techniques in the context of solving real-world and mathematical problems.

4. Represent three-dimensional figures using nets made up of rectangles and triangles, and use the nets to find the surface area of these figures. Apply these techniques in the context of solving real-world and mathematical problems.


# Statistics and Probability

# A. Develop understanding of statistical variability.

1. Recognize a statistical question as one that anticipates variability in the data related to the question and accounts for it in the answers. For example, “How old am $I ? ^ { \\prime \\prime }$ is not a statistical question, but “How old are the students in my school?” is a statistical question because one anticipates variability in students’ ages.

2. Understand that a set of data collected to answer a statistical question has a distribution that can be described by its center, spread, and overall shape.

3. Recognize that a measure of center for a numerical data set summarizes all of its values with a single number, while a measure of variation describes how its values vary with a single number.


# B. Summarize and describe distributions.

4. Display numerical data in plots on a number line, including dot plots, histograms, and box plots.

5. Summarize numerical data sets in relation to their context, such as by: a. Reporting the number of observations. b. Describing the nature of the attribute under investigation, including how it was measured and its units of measurement. c. Giving quantitative measures of center (median and/or mean) and variability (interquartile range) as well as describing any overall pattern and any striking deviations from the overall pattern with reference to the context in which the data were gathered. d. Relating the choice of measures of center and variability to the shape of the data distribution and the context in which the data were gathered.


### 3.8 Grade 7

# 
# Grade Level Overview

(1) Students extend their understanding of ratios and develop understanding of proportionality to solve single- and multi-step problems. Students use their understanding of ratios and proportionality to solve a wide variety of percent problems, including those involving discounts, interest, taxes, tips, and percent increase or decrease. Students solve problems about scale drawings by relating corresponding lengths between the objects or by using the fact that relationships of lengths within an object are preserved in similar objects. Students graph proportional relationships and understand the unit rate informally as a measure of the steepness of the related line, called the slope. They distinguish proportional relationships from other relationships.

(2) Students develop a unified understanding of number, recognizing fractions, decimals (that have a finite or a repeating decimal representation), and percents as different representations of rational numbers. Students extend addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division to all rational numbers, maintaining the properties of operations and the relationships between addition and subtraction, and multiplication and division. By applying these properties, and by viewing negative numbers in terms of everyday contexts (e.g., amounts owed or temperatures below zero), students explain and interpret the rules for adding, subtracting, multiplying, and dividing with negative numbers. They use the arithmetic of rational numbers as they formulate expressions and equations in one variable and use these equations to solve problems.

(3) Students continue their work with area from Grade 6, solving problems involving the area and circumference of a circle and surface area of three-dimensional objects. In preparation for work on congruence and similarity in Grade 8 they reason about relationships among two-dimensional figures using scale drawings and informal geometric constructions, and they gain familiarity with the relationships between angles formed by intersecting lines. Students work with three-dimensional figures, relating them to two-dimensional figures by examining cross-sections. They solve real-world and mathematical problems involving area, surface area, and volume of two- and three-dimensional objects composed of triangles, quadrilaterals, polygons, cubes and right prisms.

(4) Students build on their previous work with single data distributions to compare two data distributions and address questions about differences between populations. They begin informal work with random sampling to generate data sets and learn about the importance of representative samples for drawing inferences.

# Ratios and Proportional Relationships

# A. Analyze proportional relationships and use them to solve real-world and mathematical problems.

1. Compute unit rates associated with ratios of fractions, including ratios of lengths, areas, and other quantities measured in like or different units. For example, if a person walks ½ mile in each ¼ hour, compute the unit rate as the complex fraction $% / %$ miles per hour, equivalently 2 miles per hour.

2. Recognize and represent proportional relationships between quantities.


a. Decide whether two quantities are in a proportional relationship, e.g., by testing for equivalent ratios in a table or graphing on a coordinate plane and observing whether the graph is a straight line through the origin.

b. Identify the constant of proportionality (unit rate) in tables, graphs, equations, diagrams, and verbal descriptions of proportional relationships.

c. Represent proportional relationships by equations. For example, if total cost t is proportional to the number n of items purchased at a constant price $p ,$ , the relationship between the total cost and the number of items can be expressed as $t = p n$ .

d. Explain what a point $( x , y )$ on the graph of a proportional relationship means in terms of the situation, with special attention to the points (0, 0) and $( 1 , r )$ where $r$ is the unit rate.

3. Use proportional relationships to solve multi-step ratio and percent problems of simple interest, tax, markups and markdowns, gratuities and commissions, fees, percent increase and decrease, and percent error.

# The Number System

# A. Apply and extend previous understandings of operations with fractions to add, subtract, multiply, and divide rational numbers.

1. Apply and extend previous understandings of addition and subtraction to add and subtract rational numbers; represent addition and subtraction on a horizontal or vertical number line diagram.

a. Describe situations in which opposite quantities combine to make 0. For example, a hydrogen atom has 0 charge because its two constituents are oppositely charged.

b. Understand $p + q$ as the number located a distance $\| q \|$ from $p$ , in the positive or negative direction depending on whether $q$ is positive or negative. Show that a number and its opposite have a sum of 0 (are additive inverses). Interpret sums of rational numbers by describing real-world contexts.

c. Understand subtraction of rational numbers as adding the additive inverse, $p - q = p + ( - q )$ . Show that the distance between two rational numbers on the number line is the absolute value of their difference, and apply this principle in real-world contexts.

d. Apply properties of operations as strategies to add and subtract rational numbers.

2. Apply and extend previous understandings of multiplication and division and of fractions to multiply and divide rational numbers.

a. Understand that multiplication is extended from fractions to rational numbers by requiring that operations continue to satisfy the properties of operations, particularly the distributive property, leading to products such as $( - 1 ) ( - 1 ) = 1$ and the rules for multiplying signed numbers. Interpret products of rational numbers by describing real-world contexts.

b. Understand that integers can be divided, provided that the divisor is not zero, and every quotient of integers (with non-zero divisor) is a rational number. If $p$ and $q$ are integers, then $- ( p / q ) = ( - p ) / q = p / ( - q )$ . Interpret quotients of rational numbers by describing real-world contexts.

c. Apply properties of operations as strategies to multiply and divide rational numbers.

d. Convert a rational number to a decimal using long division; know that the decimal form of a rational number terminates in 0s or eventually repeats.

3. Solve real-world and mathematical problems involving the four operations with rational numbers.1

# Expressions and Equations

# A. Use properties of operations to generate equivalent expressions.

1. Apply properties of operations as strategies to add, subtract, factor, and expand linear expressions with rational coefficients to include multiple grouping symbols (e.g., parentheses, brackets, and braces).

2. Understand that rewriting an expression in different forms in a problem context can shed light on the problem and how the quantities in it are related. For example, $a + 0 . 0 5 a = 1 . 0 5 a$ means that “increase by $5 %$ is the same as “multiply by 1.05.”


# B. Solve real-life and mathematical problems using numerical and algebraic expressions and equations.

3. Solve multi-step real-life and mathematical problems posed with positive and negative rational numbers in any form (whole numbers, fractions, and decimals), using tools strategically. Apply properties of operations to calculate with numbers in any form; convert between forms as appropriate; and assess the reasonableness of answers using mental computation and estimation strategies. For example: If a woman making $$ 25$ an hour gets a 10% raise, she will make an additional ${ \\mathit { 1 } } / { \\mathit { 1 0 } }$ of her salary an hour, or $$ 2.50,$ for a new salary of $$ 27.50$ . If you want to place a towel bar $9 3 / 4$ inches long in the center of a door that is $2 7 \ : 1 / 2$ inches wide, you will need to place the bar about 9 inches from each edge; this estimate can be used as a check on the exact computation.

4. Use variables to represent quantities in a real-world or mathematical problem, and construct simple equations and inequalities to solve problems by reasoning about the quantities.


a. Solve word problems leading to equations of the form $p x + q = r$ and $p ( x + q ) = r$ , where $p , q$ , and $r$ are specific rational numbers. Solve equations of these forms fluently. Compare an algebraic solution to an arithmetic solution, identifying the sequence of the operations used in each approach. For example, the perimeter of a rectangle is 54 cm. Its length is 6 cm. What is its width?

b. Solve word problems leading to inequalities of the form $p x + q > r , p x + q \\geq r , p x + q < r$ or $p x + q \\leq r ,$ , where $p , q$ , and $r$ are specific rational numbers. Graph the solution set of the inequality and interpret it in the context of the problem. For example: As a salesperson, you are paid $$ 50$ per week plus $$ 3$ per sale. This week you want your pay to be at least $$ 100$ . Write an inequality for the number of sales you need to make, and describe the solutions.

# Geometry

# A. Draw, construct, and describe geometrical figures and describe the relationships between them.

1. Solve problems involving scale drawings of geometric figures, such as computing actual lengths and areas from a scale drawing and reproducing a scale drawing at a different scale.
2. Draw (freehand, with ruler and protractor, or with technology) geometric shapes with given conditions. (Focus is on triangles from three measures of angles or sides, noticing when the conditions determine one and only one triangle, more than one triangle, or no triangle.)
3. Describe the two-dimensional figures that result from slicing three-dimensional figures, as in plane sections of right rectangular prisms and right rectangular pyramids.

# B. Solve real-life and mathematical problems involving angle measure, area, surface area, and volume.

4. Know the formulas for the area and circumference of a circle and use them to solve problems; give an informal derivation of the relationship between the circumference and area of a circle.
5. Use facts about supplementary, complementary, vertical, and adjacent angles in a multi-step problem to write and solve simple equations for an unknown angle in a figure.
6. Solve real-world and mathematical problems involving area, volume and surface area of two- and threedimensional objects composed of triangles, quadrilaterals, polygons, cubes, and right prisms. (Pyramids limited to surface area only.)

# Statistics and Probability

# A. Use random sampling to draw inferences about a population.

1. Understand that statistics can be used to gain information about a population by examining a sample of the population; generalizations about a population from a sample are valid only if the sample is representative of that population. Understand that random sampling tends to produce representative samples and support valid inferences.
2. Use data from a random sample to draw inferences about a population with an unknown characteristic of interest. Generate multiple samples (or simulated samples) of the same size to gauge the variation in estimates or predictions. For example, estimate the mean word length in a book by randomly sampling words from the

book; predict the winner of a school election based on randomly sampled survey data. Gauge how far off the estimate or prediction might be.

# B. Draw informal comparative inferences about two populations.

3. Informally assess the degree of visual overlap of two numerical data distributions with similar variabilities using quantitative measures of center (median and/or mean) and variability (interquartile range and/or mean absolute deviation), as well as describing any overall pattern and any striking deviations from the overall pattern with reference to the context in which the data were gathered.

4. Use measures of center and measures of variability for numerical data from random samples to draw informal comparative inferences about two populations. For example, decide whether the words in a chapter of a seventh-grade science book are generally longer than the words in a chapter of a fourth-grade science book.


# C. Investigate chance processes and develop, use, and evaluate probability models.

5. Understand that the probability of a chance event is a number between 0 and 1 that expresses the likelihood of the event occurring. Larger numbers indicate greater likelihood. A probability near 0 indicates an unlikely event, a probability around ½ indicates an event that is neither unlikely nor likely, and a probability near 1 indicates a likely event.

6. Approximate the probability of a chance event by collecting data on the chance process that produces it and observing its long-run relative frequency, and predict the approximate relative frequency given the probability. For example, when rolling a number cube 600 times, predict that a 3 or 6 would be rolled roughly 200 times, but probably not exactly 200 times.

7. Develop a probability model and use it to find probabilities of events. Compare probabilities from a model to observed frequencies; if the agreement is not good, explain possible sources of the discrepancy.


a. Develop a uniform probability model by assigning equal probability to all outcomes, and use the model to determine probabilities of events. For example, if a student is selected at random from a class, find the probability that Jane will be selected and the probability that a girl will be selected.

b. Develop a probability model (which may not be uniform) by observing frequencies in data generated from a chance process. For example, find the approximate probability that a spinning penny will land heads up or that a tossed paper cup will land open-end down. Do the outcomes for the spinning penny appear to be equally likely based on the observed frequencies?

8. Find probabilities of compound events using organized lists, tables, tree diagrams, and simulation.

a. Understand that, just as with simple events, the probability of a compound event is the fraction of outcomes in the sample space for which the compound event occurs.

b. Represent sample spaces for compound events using methods such as organized lists, tables and tree diagrams. For an event described in everyday language (e.g., “rolling double sixes”), identify the outcomes in the sample space that compose the event.

c. Design and use a simulation to generate frequencies for compound events. For example, use random digits as a simulation tool to approximate the answer to the question: If $40 %$ of donors have type A blood, what is the probability that it will take at least 4 donors to find one with type A blood?

### 3.9 Grade 8


# Grade Level Overview

(1) Students use linear equations and systems of linear equations to represent, analyze, and solve a variety of problems. Students recognize equations for proportions $( y / x = m$ or $y = m x )$ as special linear equations $( y = m x + b )$ , understanding that the constant of proportionality $( m )$ is the slope, and the graphs are lines through the origin. They understand that the slope $( m )$ of a line is a constant rate of change, so that if the input or $x \\cdot$ -coordinate changes by an amount A, the output or y-coordinate changes by the amount $m { \\cdot } A$ . Students also use a linear equation to describe the association between two quantities in bivariate data (such as arm span vs. height for students in a classroom). At this grade, fitting the model, and assessing its fit to the data are done informally. Interpreting the model in the context of the data requires students to express a relationship between the two quantities in question and to interpret components of the relationship (such as slope and $\\gamma$ -intercept) in terms of the situation.

Students strategically choose and efficiently implement procedures to solve linear equations in one variable, understanding that when they use the properties of equality and the concept of logical equivalence, they maintain the solutions of the original equation. Students solve systems of two linear equations in two variables and relate the systems to pairs of lines in the plane; these intersect, are parallel, or are the same line. Students use linear equations, systems of linear equations, linear functions, and their understanding of slope of a line to analyze situations and solve problems.

(2) Students grasp the concept of a function as a rule that assigns to each input exactly one output. They understand that functions describe situations where one quantity determines another. They can translate among representations and partial representations of functions (noting that tabular and graphical representations may be partial representations), and they describe how aspects of the function are reflected in the different representations.

(3) Students use ideas about distance and angles, how they behave under translations, rotations, reflections, and dilations, and ideas about congruence and similarity to describe and analyze two-dimensional figures and to solve problems. Students show that the sum of the angles in a triangle is the angle formed by a straight line, and that various configurations of lines give rise to similar triangles because of the angles created when a transversal cuts parallel lines. Students understand the statement of the Pythagorean Theorem and its converse, and can explain why the Pythagorean Theorem holds, for example, by decomposing a square in two different ways. They apply the Pythagorean Theorem to find distances between points on the coordinate plane, to find lengths, and to analyze polygons. Students complete their work on volume by solving problems involving cones, cylinders, and spheres.

# The Number System

# A. Know that there are numbers that are not rational, and approximate them by rational numbers.

1. Know that numbers that are not rational are called irrational. Understand informally that every number has a decimal expansion; for rational numbers, show that the decimal expansion repeats eventually. Convert a decimal expansion that repeats eventually into a rational number by analyzing repeating patterns.
2. Use rational approximations of irrational numbers to compare the size of irrational numbers, locate them approximately on a number line diagram, and estimate the value of expressions (e.g., $\\pi ^ { 2 }$ ). For example, by truncating the decimal expansion of √2, show that √2 is between 1 and 2, then between 1.4 and 1.5, and explain how to continue on to get better approximations to the hundredths place.

# Expressions and Equations

# A. Work with radicals and integer exponents.

1. Know and apply the properties of integer exponents to generate equivalent numerical expressions. For example, $3 ^ { 2 } \\times 3 ^ { - 5 } = 3 ^ { - 3 } = 1 / 3 ^ { 3 } = 1 / 2 7 .$

2. Use square root and cube root symbols to represent solutions to equations of the form $x ^ { 2 } = p$ and $\\scriptstyle x ^ { 3 } = p$ , where $p$ is a positive rational number. Evaluate square roots of small perfect squares and cube roots of small perfect cubes. Know that √2 is irrational.

3. Use numbers expressed in the form of a single digit times an integer power of 10 to estimate very large or very small quantities, and to express how many times as much one is than the other. For example, estimate the population of the United States as $3 \\times 1 0 ^ { 8 }$ and the population of the world as $7 \\times 1 0 ^ { 9 } ,$ , and determine that the world population is more than 20 times larger.

4. Perform operations with numbers expressed in scientific notation, including problems where both decimal and scientific notation are used. Use scientific notation and choose units of appropriate size for measurements of very large or very small quantities (e.g., use millimeters per year for seafloor spreading). Interpret scientific notation that has been generated by technology.


# B. Understand the connections between proportional relationships, lines, and linear equations.

5. Graph proportional relationships, interpreting the unit rate as the slope of the graph. Compare two different proportional relationships represented in different ways. For example, compare a distance-time graph to a distance-time equation to determine which of two moving objects has greater speed.

6. Use similar triangles to explain why the slope $m$ is the same between any two distinct points on a non-vertical line in the coordinate plane; derive the equation $y = m x$ for a line through the origin and the equation $y = m x + b$ for a line intercepting the vertical axis at $b$ .


# C. Analyze and solve linear equations and pairs of simultaneous linear equations.

7. Solve linear equations in one variable.

a. Give examples of linear equations in one variable with one solution, infinitely many solutions, or no solutions. Show which of these possibilities is the case by successively transforming the given equation into simpler forms, until an equivalent equation of the form $\\boldsymbol { x } = \\boldsymbol { a }$ , $a = a .$ , or ${ \\boldsymbol { a } } = { \\boldsymbol { b } }$ results (where $\\pmb { q }$ and $b$ are different numbers).

b. Solve linear equations with rational number coefficients, including equations whose solutions require expanding expressions using the distributive property and collecting like terms.

8. Analyze and solve pairs of simultaneous linear equations.

a. Understand that solutions to a system of two linear equations in two variables correspond to points of intersection of their graphs, because points of intersection satisfy both equations simultaneously.

b. Solve systems of two linear equations in two variables algebraically, and estimate solutions by graphing the equations. Solve simple cases by inspection. For example, $3 x + 2 y = 5$ and $3 x + 2 y = 6$ have no solution because $3 x + 2 y$ cannot simultaneously be 5 and 6.

c. Solve real-world and mathematical problems leading to two linear equations in two variables. For example, given coordinates for two pairs of points, determine whether the line through the first pair of points intersects the line through the second pair.

# Functions

# A. Define, evaluate, and compare functions.

1. Understand that a function is a rule that assigns to each input exactly one output. The graph of a function is the set of ordered pairs consisting of an input and the corresponding output. (Function notation is not required in this grade level.)

2. Compare properties of two functions each represented in a different way (algebraically, graphically, numerically in tables, or by verbal descriptions). For example, given a linear function represented by a table of values and a linear function represented by an algebraic expression, determine which function has the greater rate of change.

3. Interpret the equation $y = m x + b$ as defining a linear function, whose graph is a straight line; categorize functions as linear or nonlinear when given equations, graphs, or tables. For example, the function $A = S ^ { 2 }$ giving the area of a square as a function of its side length is not linear because its graph contains the points (1,1), (2,4) and (3,9), which are not on a straight line.


# B. Use functions to model relationships between quantities.

4. Construct a function to model a linear relationship between two quantities. Determine the rate of change and initial value of the function from a description of a relationship or from two $( x , y )$ values, including reading these from a table or from a graph. Interpret the rate of change and initial value of a linear function in terms of the situation it models, and in terms of its graph or a table of values.

5. Describe qualitatively the functional relationship between two quantities by analyzing a graph (e.g., where the function is increasing or decreasing, linear or nonlinear). Sketch a graph that exhibits the qualitative features of a function that has been described verbally.


# Geometry

# A. Understand congruence and similarity using physical models, transparencies, or geometry software.

1. Verify experimentally the properties of rotations, reflections, and translations:

a. Lines are taken to lines, and line segments to line segments of the same length.

b. Angles are taken to angles of the same measure.

c. Parallel lines are taken to parallel lines.

2. Explain that a two-dimensional figure is congruent to another if the second can be obtained from the first by a sequence of rotations, reflections, and translations; given two congruent figures, describe a sequence that exhibits the congruence between them. (Rotations are only about the origin and reflections are only over the yaxis and $x \\cdot$ -axis in Grade 8.)

3. Describe the effect of dilations, translations, rotations, and reflections on two-dimensional figures using coordinates. (Rotations are only about the origin, dilations only use the origin as the center of dilation, and reflections are only over the y-axis and x-axis in Grade 8.)

4. Explain that a two-dimensional figure is similar to another if the second can be obtained from the first by a sequence of rotations, reflections, translations, and dilations; given two similar two-dimensional figures, describe a sequence that exhibits the similarity between them. (Rotations are only about the origin, dilations only use the origin as the center of dilation, and reflections are only over the y-axis and $x \\cdot$ -axis in Grade 8.)

5. Use informal arguments to establish facts about the angle sum and exterior angle of triangles, about the angles created when parallel lines are cut by a transversal, and the angle-angle criterion for similarity of triangles. For example, arrange three copies of the same triangle so that the sum of the three angles appears to form a line, and give an argument in terms of transversals why this is so.


# B. Understand and apply the Pythagorean Theorem.

6. Explain a proof of the Pythagorean Theorem and its converse using the area of squares.

7. Apply the Pythagorean Theorem to determine unknown side lengths in right triangles in real-world and mathematical problems in two and three dimensions.

8. Apply the Pythagorean Theorem to find the distance between two points in a coordinate system.


# C. Solve real-world and mathematical problems involving volume of cylinders, cones, and spheres.

9. Know the formulas for the volumes of cones, cylinders, and spheres and use them to solve real-world and mathematical problems.

# Statistics and Probability

# A. Investigate patterns of association in bivariate data.

1. Construct and interpret scatter plots for bivariate measurement data to investigate patterns of association between two quantities. Describe patterns such as clustering, outliers, positive or negative association, linear association, and nonlinear association.

2. Know that straight lines are widely used to model relationships between two quantitative variables. For scatter plots that suggest a linear association, informally fit a straight line, and informally assess the model fit by judging the closeness of the data points to the line.

3. Use the equation of a linear model to solve problems in the context of bivariate measurement data, interpreting the slope and intercept. For example, in a linear model for a biology experiment, interpret a slope of 1.5 cm/hr as meaning that an additional hour of sunlight each day is associated with an additional 1.5 cm in mature plant height.

4. Understand that patterns of association can also be seen in bivariate categorical data by displaying frequencies and relative frequencies in a two-way table. Construct and interpret a two-way table summarizing data on two categorical variables collected from the same subjects. Use relative frequencies calculated for rows or columns to describe possible association between the two variables. For example, collect data from students in your class on whether or not they have a curfew on school nights and whether or not they have assigned chores at home. Is there evidence that those who have a curfew also tend to have chores?


# Number and Quantity

# The Real Number System

# B. Use properties of rational and irrational numbers.

3. Explain why the sum or product of two rational numbers is rational; that the sum of a rational number and an irrational number is irrational; and that the product of a nonzero rational number and an irrational number is irrational.

# Quantities★

# A. Reason quantitatively and use units to solve problems.

1. Use units as a way to understand problems and to guide the solution of multi-step problems; choose and interpret units consistently in formulas; choose and interpret the scale and the origin in graphs and data displays. 2. Define appropriate quantities for the purpose of descriptive modeling. 3. Choose a level of accuracy appropriate to limitations on measurement when reporting quantities.

# Algebra

# Seeing Structure in Expressions

A1: A-SSE

# A. Interpret the structure of expressions.

1. Interpret expressions that represent a quantity in terms of its context. ★

a. Interpret parts of an expression, such as terms, factors, and coefficients.

b. Interpret complicated expressions by viewing one or more of their parts as a single entity. For example, interpret $P ( \\boldsymbol { \\mathrm { 1 + r } } ) ^ { n }$ as the product of P and a factor not depending on $P$ .

2. Use the structure of an expression to identify ways to rewrite it. For example, $5 e e x ^ { 4 } - y ^ { 4 } a s ( x ^ { 2 } ) ^ { 2 } - ( y ^ { 2 } ) ^ { 2 } ,$ , thus recognizing it as a difference of squares that can be factored as $( x ^ { 2 } - y ^ { 2 } ) ( x ^ { 2 } + y ^ { 2 } ) ,$ , or see $2 x ^ { 2 } + 8 x$ as $( 2 x ) ( x ) + 2 x ( 4 ) ,$ thus recognizing it as a polynomial whose terms are products of monomials and the polynomial can be factored as $2 x ( x { + } 4 )$ .

# B. Write expressions in equivalent forms to solve problems.

3. Choose and produce an equivalent form of an expression to reveal and explain properties of the quantity represented by the expression. ★

a. Factor a quadratic expression to reveal the zeros of the function it defines.

b. Complete the square in a quadratic expression to reveal the maximum or minimum value of the function it defines.

c. Use the properties of exponents to transform expressions for exponential functions emphasizing integer exponents. For example, the growth of bacteria can be modeled by either $f ( t ) = 3 ^ { ( t + 2 ) }$ or $g ( t ) = 9 ( 3 ^ { t } )$ because the expression $3 ^ { ( t + 2 ) }$ can be rewritten as $( 3 ^ { t } ) ( 3 ^ { 2 } ) = 9 ( 3 ^ { t } )$ .

# Arithmetic with Polynomials and Rational Expressions

A1: A-APR

A. Perform arithmetic operations on polynomials.

1. Understand that polynomials form a system analogous to the integers, namely, they are closed under the operations of addition, subtraction, and multiplication; add, subtract, and multiply polynomials.

B. Understand the relationship between zeros and factors of polynomials.

3. Identify zeros of quadratic functions, and use the zeros to sketch a graph of the function defined by the polynomial.

# Creating Equations★

# A. Create equations that describe numbers or relationships.

1. Create equations and inequalities in one variable and use them to solve problems. Include equations arising from linear, quadratic, and exponential functions.

2. Create equations in two or more variables to represent relationships between quantities; graph equations on coordinate axes with labels and scales.

3. Represent constraints by equations or inequalities, and by systems of equations and/or inequalities, and interpret solutions as viable or nonviable options in a modeling context. For example, represent inequalities describing nutritional and cost constraints on combinations of different foods.

4. Rearrange formulas to highlight a quantity of interest, using the same reasoning as in solving equations. For example, rearrange Ohm’s law $V = I R$ to highlight resistance R.


# Reasoning with Equations and Inequalities

A1: A-REI

# A. Understand solving equations as a process of reasoning and explain the reasoning.

1. Explain each step in solving a simple equation as following from the equality of numbers asserted at the previous step, starting from the assumption that the original equation has a solution. Construct a viable argument to justify a solution method.

# B. Solve equations and inequalities in one variable.

3. Solve linear equations and inequalities in one variable, including equations with coefficients represented by letters.

4. Solve quadratic equations in one variable.


a. Use the method of completing the square to transform any quadratic equation in $x$ into an equation of the form $( x - p ) ^ { 2 } = q$ that has the same solutions. Derive the quadratic formula from this form.

b. Solve quadratic equations by inspection (e.g., for $x ^ { 2 } = 4 9$ ), taking square roots, completing the square, the quadratic formula, and factoring, as appropriate to the initial form of the equation. Recognize when the quadratic formula gives complex solutions and write them as "no real solution.”

# C. Solve systems of equations.

5. Prove that, given a system of two equations in two variables, replacing one equation by the sum of that equatio and a multiple of the other produces a system with the same solutions.

6. Solve systems of linear equations exactly and approximately (e.g., with graphs), focusing on pairs of linear equations in two variables.


# D. Represent and solve equations and inequalities graphically.

10. Understand that the graph of an equation in two variables is the set of all its solutions plotted in the coordinate plane, often forming a curve (which could be a line).

11. Explain why the $x$ -coordinates of the points where the graphs of the equations $\\gamma = f ( \\boldsymbol { x } )$ and $y = g ( x )$ intersect are the solutions of the equation $f ( x ) = g ( x ) ;$ find the solutions approximately, e.g., using technology to graph the functions, make tables of values, or find successive approximations. Include cases where $f ( x )$ and/or $g ( x )$ are linear, polynomial, rational, piecewise linear (to include absolute value), and exponential functions.★

12. Graph the solutions to a linear inequality in two variables as a half-plane (excluding the boundary in the case of a strict inequality), and graph the solution set to a system of linear inequalities in two variables as the intersection of the corresponding half-planes.


# Functions

# Interpreting Functions

# A. Understand the concept of a function and use function notation.

1. Understand that a function from one set (called the domain) to another set (called the range) assigns to each element of the domain exactly one element of the range. If $f$ is a function and $x$ is an element of its domain, then $f ( x )$ denotes the output of $f$ corresponding to the input x. The graph of $f$ is the graph of the equation $\\boldsymbol { y } = f ( \\boldsymbol { x } )$ .

2. Use function notation, evaluate functions for inputs in their domains, and interpret statements that use function notation in terms of a context.

3. Recognize that sequences are functions whose domain is a subset of the integers. Relate arithmetic sequences to linear functions and geometric sequences to exponential functions.

Additive inverses. Two numbers whose sum is 0 are additive inverses of one another. Example: 3/4 and – 3/4 are additive inverses of one another because $3 / 4 + ( - 3 / 4 ) = ( - 3 / 4 ) + 3 / 4 = 0 .$ .

Associative property of addition. See Table 3 in this Glossary.

Associative property of multiplication. See Table 3 in this Glossary.

Expected value. For a random variable, the weighted average of its possible values, with weights given by their respective probabilities.

First quartile. For a data set with median $M ,$ , the first quartile is the median of the data values less than M. Example: For the data set {1, 3, 6, 7, 10, 12, 14, 15, 22, 120}, the first quartile is 6.26 See also: median, third quartile, interquartile range.

Fraction. A number expressible in the form $a / b$ where $\\pmb { q }$ is a whole number and $b$ is a positive whole number. (The word fraction in these standards always refers to a nonnegative number.) See also: rational number.

Identity property of 0. See Table 3 in this Glossary.

Independently combined probability models. Two probability models are said to be combined independently if the probability of each ordered pair in the combined model equals the product of the original probabilities of the two individual outcomes in the ordered pair.

Integer. A number expressible in the form a or $- a$ for some whole number a.

Interquartile Range. A measure of variation in a set of numerical data, the interquartile range is the distance between the first and third quartiles of the data set. Example: For the data set {1, 3, 6, 7, 10, 12, 14, 15, 22, 120}, the interquartile range is $1 5 - 6 = 9$ . See also: first quartile, third quartile.

Line plot. A method of visually displaying a distribution of data values where each data value is shown as a dot or mark above a number line. Also known as a dot plot.27

Tape diagram. A drawing that looks like a segment of tape, used to illustrate number relationships. Also known as a strip diagram, bar model, fraction strip, or length model.

Terminating decimal. A decimal is called terminating if its repeating digit is 0.

Third quartile. For a data set with median M, the third quartile is the median of the data values greater than M. Example: For the data set {2, 3, 6, 7, 10, 12, 14, 15, 22, 120}, the third quartile is 15. See also: median, first quartile, interquartile range.

Trapezoid: A quadrilateral with at least one pair of parallel sides.

Transitivity principle for indirect measurement. If the length of object A is greater than the length of object B, and the length of object B is greater than the length of object C, then the length of object A is greater than the length of object C. This principle applies to measurement of other quantities as well.

1These take apart situations can be used to show all the decompositions of a given number. The associated equations, which have the total on the left of the equal sign, help children understand that the $=$ sign does not always mean makes or results in but always does mean is the same number as.

Either addend can be unknown, so there are three variations of these problem situations. Both Addends Unknown is a productive extension of this basic situation, specially for small numbers less than or equal to 10.

3For the Bigger Unknown or Smaller Unknown situations, one version directs the correct operation (the version using more for the bigger unknown and using less for the smaller unknown). The other versions are more difficult.

4The language in the array examples shows the easiest form of array problems. A harder form is to use the terms rows and columns: The apples in the grocery window are in 3 rows and 6 columns. How many apples are in there? Both forms are valuable. 5Area involves arrays of squares that have been pushed together so that there are no gaps or overlaps, so array problems include these especially important measurement situations.

## 6. Resources

Local districts are free to use any materials that are appropriate to meet the needs of students. The LDOE offers these optional resources for consideration by districts as ways to support their teachers in implementing the new Louisiana Student Standards for Mathematics.

### 6.1 Instructional Materials Review (IMR)

In Louisiana, all districts are able to purchase instructional materials that are best for their local communities. The Louisiana Department of Education engages in an online review of instructional materials to determine the degree of alignment with state content standards to support districts with these decisions. Based on these reviews, instructional materials fall into one of three categories:

**TIER 1 - EXEMPLIFIES QUALITY**: Meets all non-negotiable criteria and scored the best possible on all indicators of superior quality.

**TIER 2 - APPROACHING QUALITY**: Meets all non-negotiable criteria and some indicators of superior quality.

**TIER 3 - NOT REPRESENTING QUALITY**: Does not meet non-negotiable criteria.

The Department will continue to review and evaluate instructional materials based on the standards in place at the time of the review. Additionally, the Department will conduct additional reviews when standards change and publishers update their materials upon request. Click here to see up-to-date annotated reviews of instructional materials.

### 6.2 K-8 Math Standards by Domain

This document arranges the math standards for Kindergarten through Grade 8 in such a way to show how mathematical concepts are built within each domain and how those concepts progress across grades. This progression shows the coherence across grades within each domain that can be used to inform teaching and learning.

### 6.3 Louisiana Student Standards for Mathematics: Companion Document for Teachers

These are grade or course level documents designed to assist teachers in interpreting and implementing the standards through the use of descriptions and examples.

### 6.4 Math Remediation Guides

These guides, one for each grade or course, are designed to help teachers more quickly determine the required previous knowledge needed for each individual standard using easy-to-access charts.

Available for: Kindergarten, Grade 1, Grade 2, Grade 3, Grade 4, Grade 5, Grade 6, Grade 7, Grade 8, Algebra I, Geometry, Algebra II

## 7. Conclusion: The Competitive Moat

This RAG context guide represents the platform's competitive advantage for K-12 mathematics instruction because it embeds four types of knowledge that cannot be easily replicated:

**State-Specific Knowledge**: Exact Louisiana K-12 standards text, vertical progressions across all grades, and local context that generic tools lack

**Developmental Knowledge**: Deep understanding of how mathematical concepts develop from Kindergarten through high school, including progressions, prerequisite relationships, and common misconceptions

**Pedagogical Knowledge**: Research-based instructional practices including concrete-representational-abstract sequencing, problem types, fluency development, and standards-based teaching aligned with how students learn mathematics

**Temporal Knowledge**: Awareness of typical K-12 pacing, seasonal instructional focus, and the natural rhythm of the school year across all grade levels

When combined, these knowledge domains transform generic AI assistance into a proactive, developmentally-appropriate, trustworthy partner that anticipates educator needs, ensures quality and standards alignment, provides appropriate differentiation, and recognizes the unique needs of mathematics instruction across all grade levels. This is the moat that prevents competitors from offering equivalent value for Louisiana K-12 mathematics education, even if they have access to similar AI models.
