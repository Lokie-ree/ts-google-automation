## 1. Introduction to Louisiana K-12 Computer Science Standards

### 1.1 Development of K-12 Louisiana Student Standards for Computer Science

Louisiana Act 541 (2022), the Computer Science Education Act, aimed to establish a comprehensive and seamless statewide computer science education program across all educational levels to meet the demands of a dynamic economy. To achieve this goal, Act 541 created the Computer Science Education Advisory Commission (CSEAC). CSEAC was responsible for advising the State Board of Elementary and Secondary Education (BESE) through the state Department of Education (LDOE) to develop and implement a state action plan for delivering education in computer science in all public schools.

On October 11, 2023, the State Board of Elementary and Secondary Education (BESE) received the formal report from the CSEAC and subsequently directed the Louisiana Department of Education (LDOE) to develop a comprehensive set of K-12 computer science content standards. Upon BESE approval of the timeline, process, and overall structure of the K-12 Computer Standards Writing Committee, members were selected through a competitive application process. The committee, comprised of diverse stakeholders, such as classroom educators, school system leaders, business and industry representatives, higher education faculty, and parents, ensured a collaborative and comprehensive approach to the standards development process.

From May to August 2024, the K-12 Computer Standards Writing Committee drafted student-centered and developmentally appropriate computer science standards within defined grade bands: elementary (K–5), middle school (6–8), and high school (9–12). These standards were carefully designed to reflect the increasing complexity and depth of understanding expected as students progress through each educational stage, with a focus on analytical and critical thinking skills, digital literacy, digital citizenship, and technology skills.

The proposed standards underwent public review and comment, allowing stakeholders the opportunity to provide feedback. In October 2024, BESE received the K-12 Louisiana Student Standards for Computer Science, which now serve as the guiding framework for high-quality computer science instruction across the state, ensuring Louisiana students are prepared to excel in the digital age.

The practice also includes consideration of user needs and feedback, and refining artifacts to enhance reliability, usability, and accessibility.

### 4.7 Core Practice 7: Communicating about computing

Communication is a key part of computer science, facilitating both personal expression and collaboration. Sharing ideas clearly with a variety of audiences, explaining how and why computation is used, and reflecting on the impact, better equips stakeholders for collaborative projects. Effective communication also entails writing meaningful comments, documenting work, and presenting thinking through different forms of media. Emphasis is placed on using precise language and tailoring communication to meet the needs of the intended audience.

## 5. Conclusion: The Competitive Moat

This RAG context guide represents the platform's competitive advantage for K-12 computer science instruction because it embeds four types of knowledge that cannot be easily replicated:

**State-Specific Knowledge**: Exact Louisiana K-12 computer science standards text, vertical progressions across all grade bands, and local context that generic tools lack. This includes Louisiana-specific implementation guidance and state-level computer science education priorities.

**Developmental Knowledge**: Deep understanding of how computer science concepts develop from Kindergarten through high school, including computational thinking progressions, programming skill development, and the integration of core concepts and practices across grade bands.

**Pedagogical Knowledge**: Research-based instructional practices including computational thinking frameworks, project-based learning approaches, debugging strategies, and the integration of core practices with content knowledge aligned with how students learn computer science.

**Temporal Knowledge**: Awareness of typical K-12 pacing, seasonal instructional focus, and the natural rhythm of the school year across all grade levels, including understanding of how computer science concepts build upon each other and how industry practices connect to classroom learning.

When combined, these knowledge domains transform generic AI assistance into a proactive, developmentally-appropriate, trustworthy partner that anticipates educator needs, ensures quality and standards alignment, provides appropriate differentiation, recognizes the unique needs of computer science instruction across all grade levels, and supports the cultivation of digitally literate, computationally-fluent students. This is the moat that prevents competitors from offering equivalent value for Louisiana K-12 computer science education, even if they have access to similar AI models.
