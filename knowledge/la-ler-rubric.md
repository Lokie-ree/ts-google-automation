# Louisiana Educator Rubric RAG Context Guide
## Comprehensive Reference for AI-Powered Educator Evaluation and Support

---

## Executive Summary

This document serves as the authoritative RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) context for an educator support platform designed to assist Louisiana teachers in understanding, implementing, and improving their instructional practice based on the Louisiana Educator Rubric. The platform's four Co-Pilot features—Weekly Spark, Alignment Scorecard, Delta Generator, and Innovation Remix Engine—leverage this localized, pedagogically-grounded context to provide proactive, rubric-aligned support that competitors cannot replicate.

**Platform Differentiator**: This RAG context transforms generic AI tools into hyper-local, Louisiana-specific educational partners by embedding the state's educator evaluation rubric, performance level descriptors, and instructional best practices directly into every platform interaction for teacher development and support.

## 1. Introduction to the Louisiana Educator Rubric

### 1.1 Overview and Development

The Louisiana Educator Rubric was designed through a partnership between the Louisiana Department of Education (LDOE) and the National Institute for Excellence in Teaching (NIET) to directly support improvements in classroom instruction. By clearly defining effective teaching and student-centered instruction, this rubric provides educators with a roadmap for strengthening their practice, facilitating high-quality coaching, and fostering collaboration around best instructional practices.

The rubric is grounded in the NIET's Teaching and Learning Standards Rubric, which is based on 20 years of research and experience across 21 states, and it has been used by educators in environments ranging from urban to rural areas and in classrooms of all subjects and modalities. The rubric provides educators with a common understanding and language for designing and planning instruction and using effective instructional practices to support student learning.

**Released**: April 2024

### 1.2 Rubric Structure and Performance Levels

The Louisiana Educator Rubric brings a comprehensive focus on four key domains: **Instruction**, **Planning**, **Environment**, and **Professionalism**. Each domain is further broken down into indicators and descriptors that clearly define effective teaching.

**Performance Levels**: Performance definitions are provided at levels 5, 3, and 1. Observers can score performance at levels 2 or 4 based on evidence and their professional judgment.

- **Level 5 (Exemplary)**: Significantly Above Expectations - Consistent Evidence of Student-Centered Learning/Student Ownership of Learning. Teacher and Students Facilitate the Learning.
- **Level 4**: Many descriptors from Level 3 are evident and strong, but there is not enough evidence or consistency to merit an exemplary rating of 5.
- **Level 3 (Proficient)**: At Expectations - Some Evidence of Student-Centered Learning/Student Ownership of Learning. Teacher Facilitates the Learning.
- **Level 2**: Examination of the evidence is stronger than unsatisfactory, but there is not enough specific evidence to merit a proficient rating.
- **Level 1 (Unsatisfactory)**: Significantly Below Expectations - Minimal Evidence of Student Ownership of Learning. Heavy Emphasis on Teacher Direction.

**Note**: These ratings should always be based on close evaluation of evidence, including student work and observation analysis.

## 6. Key Definitions

### 6.1 Expectations (Success Criteria)

**Expectations** (also known as Success Criteria) refers to a concrete learning performance: something students will say, do, or make to indicate they are moving towards the learning goal/objective.

### 6.2 High-Quality Instructional Materials (HQIM)

**High-quality instructional materials (HQIM)** is fully aligned to state content standards, or national or local when state standards are not provided—what students are expected to learn and be able to do at the end of each grade level or course—and builds content-specific knowledge and skills. HQIM provides support for all learners and high-quality resources for teachers to support the delivery of meaningful instruction every day, including:

- Effective lesson structures and strategies
- Appropriate pacing guidance
- Meaningful, connected assessments
- Implementation guidance and resources

## 7. Understanding the Louisiana Educator Rubric Performance Framework

### 7.1 Three-Level Performance Descriptors

The Louisiana Educator Rubric employs a thoughtful three-level framework for describing teaching performance, with flexibility for observers to assign intermediate ratings based on available evidence. This framework helps teachers and observers develop shared understanding of what effective instruction looks like at different stages of professional development.

**Exemplary performance at Level 5** represents consistent evidence of student-centered learning and student ownership of the learning process, where both teacher and students actively facilitate learning. At this level, instruction transcends teacher direction to create learning environments where students drive their own growth, demonstrate deep understanding, articulate their thinking to peers, and take initiative to meet or exceed expectations. Teachers operating at this level consistently implement sophisticated instructional strategies, anticipate student needs before they arise, create regular opportunities for student autonomy and choice, and foster classroom cultures where students learn from mistakes and can describe their own thinking processes. The descriptor "consistent evidence" signals that these practices are not occasional highlights but regular features of instruction.

**Proficient performance at Level 3** represents the expected level of effective teaching in Louisiana schools, characterized by some evidence of student-centered learning and student ownership, with the teacher facilitating the learning process. Teachers at this level implement research-based instructional practices reliably, use high-quality instructional materials effectively, create structured opportunities for student engagement and growth, and demonstrate solid understanding of content and pedagogy. The distinction between Exemplary and Proficient often rests on the degree of student ownership and the consistency with which sophisticated practices are implemented. Proficient teachers create strong learning environments; Exemplary teachers create environments where students increasingly direct their own learning.

**Unsatisfactory performance at Level 1** represents minimal evidence of student ownership of learning, with heavy emphasis on teacher direction. At this level, instruction may not effectively support student progress toward standards, teacher practices do not yet demonstrate proficiency in key instructional and planning skills, and opportunities for student engagement or meaningful learning may be limited. This level signals need for substantial support and professional development to move toward Proficient practice.

**Intermediate ratings of 2 and 4** provide nuance within this framework. A rating of 2 often occurs when examination of evidence is stronger than unsatisfactory but does not yet merit a Proficient rating. Perhaps the teacher is implementing some effective practices but not yet consistently, or key elements of Proficient practice remain underdeveloped. A rating of 4 often occurs when many Proficient descriptors are evident and strong, but there is not yet enough evidence or consistency to merit an Exemplary rating. Perhaps the teacher implements Proficient practices very well but has not yet fully developed the student ownership and autonomy that characterize Exemplary practice. These intermediate ratings should always be based on close evaluation of evidence, including student work and observation analysis, rather than vague impressions.

### 7.2 Supporting Movement Across Performance Levels

Pelican AI features are calibrated to support teachers at all performance levels while particularly emphasizing the journey from Proficient toward Exemplary practice. The platform recognizes that most Louisiana teachers are performing at or near the Proficient level and seeks to help them strengthen their practice systematically.

**The Weekly Spark** provides differentiated suggestions based on where teachers are in their practice development. For teachers working toward Proficient practice, it offers clear guidance on implementing the core instructional strategies described in rubric indicators, with explicit connections to what Proficient performance looks like for specific indicators. For teachers already at Proficient level seeking to reach Exemplary, it suggests concrete ways to increase student ownership, deepen thinking demands, and create more sophisticated learning experiences that shift greater responsibility to students.

**The Alignment Scorecard** explicitly references performance level descriptors when providing feedback on teacher-created content. Rather than simply noting whether content is adequate or needs improvement, it explains which specific rubric descriptor is being met, what evidence would demonstrate Proficient or Exemplary practice, and what particular gaps exist between current content and rubric expectations. This approach helps teachers understand not just what to improve but why certain practices matter and how they connect to Louisiana's comprehensive vision for excellent instruction.

**The Delta Generator** helps teachers implement differentiation at increasing levels of sophistication. Basic differentiation that accommodates different learning needs represents Proficient practice, while sophisticated differentiation that allows students to make informed choices about their learning pathways while maintaining rigorous grade-level standards represents Exemplary practice. The tool provides guidance appropriate to each level, helping teachers understand how their current differentiation practices align with rubric expectations and what next steps would move them toward more advanced implementation.

**The Innovation Remix Engine** maintains rubric alignment across all translations of instructional frameworks, ensuring that when teachers share practices, those shared innovations support movement toward higher performance levels rather than inadvertently lowering expectations or quality. When teachers share exemplary innovations, the Remix Engine preserves the characteristics that made them exemplary while adapting them appropriately for new grade levels or subject areas.

### 7.3 High-Quality Instructional Materials Integration

The Louisiana Educator Rubric consistently references high-quality instructional materials as the foundation for effective planning, instruction, and assessment. This emphasis reflects Louisiana's commitment to curriculum-based reform and recognition that coherent, well-designed instructional materials provide essential support for both teachers and students.

High-quality instructional materials are fully aligned to state content standards, building content-specific knowledge and skills systematically across grade levels. These materials provide support for all learners through embedded differentiation strategies and scaffolding. They offer high-quality resources for teachers to support meaningful instruction every day, including effective lesson structures and strategies, appropriate pacing guidance that accounts for the complexity of standards and typical student learning progression, meaningful and connected assessments that provide formative and summative data, and comprehensive implementation guidance and resources that help teachers internalize the curriculum's design.

Pelican AI is designed to work in concert with high-quality instructional materials rather than to replace or compete with them. The platform helps teachers internalize their adopted curriculum more effectively, understand the instructional design embedded within their materials, identify appropriate opportunities for supplementation or modification while maintaining curriculum coherence, and ensure that any teacher-created content maintains the rigor and alignment of the adopted curriculum.

**The Weekly Spark** references the specific high-quality instructional materials that Louisiana districts have adopted, providing guidance that acknowledges and builds upon the curriculum's design rather than suggesting alternatives. **The Alignment Scorecard** validates that teacher-created content maintains alignment with both Louisiana standards and the adopted curriculum's approach. **The Delta Generator** ensures that differentiation strategies preserve the curriculum's instructional sequences and conceptual development. **The Innovation Remix Engine** helps teachers see how principles embedded in their high-quality instructional materials apply across different contexts and content areas.

## 8. Four Core Features With Rubric Alignment

### 8.1 Weekly Spark: Proactive Standards-Aligned Support

The Weekly Spark feature provides anticipatory support that aligns with Louisiana pacing guides and state standards, delivering timely guidance that helps teachers prepare for upcoming instructional challenges before they arise. This proactive approach respects the reality that teachers have limited planning time and benefit from just-in-time support that addresses their immediate needs.

The feature integrates deeply with multiple Louisiana Educator Rubric indicators within the Instruction and Planning domains. **Standards and Objectives** alignment ensures that Weekly Spark suggestions include clear, measurable objectives that explicitly communicate what students will learn and why. The feature helps teachers connect objectives to what students have previously learned and to life experiences, supporting the Exemplary level descriptor that requires students to "make connections between learning objectives and what they have previously learned, know from life experiences, and knowledge of other disciplines." Rather than providing isolated lesson ideas, Weekly Spark embeds suggestions within the larger learning progression, helping teachers articulate how each lesson builds on prior learning and prepares for future concepts.

**Motivating Students** support organizes content to be personally meaningful, relevant, and intellectually engaging to students. Weekly Spark suggestions help teachers develop learning experiences where inquiry, curiosity, and exploration are valued, addressing the Proficient descriptor requiring teachers to "organize the content, including high-quality curriculum resources, so that it is personally meaningful and relevant to students." The feature provides concrete hooks and entry points that connect academic content to students' lived experiences, interests, and community contexts, moving beyond generic engagement strategies to Louisiana-specific examples that resonate with students in particular regions, communities, or cultural contexts.

**Lesson Structure and Pacing** guidance creates coherent structure with appropriate pacing, time for reflection, and efficient transitions. Weekly Spark provides templates and suggestions that help teachers meet the Proficient descriptor requiring lessons to have "a structure that is coherent, based on the content, and has a beginning, middle, and end, with time for reflection to ensure student understanding." The feature considers the typical pacing of Louisiana curricula and the rhythm of the school year, providing suggestions that account for factors such as assessment windows, school breaks, and the varying cognitive demands of different standards.

**Presenting Instructional Content** recommendations include visuals that establish the purpose of the lesson, examples and illustrations for new concepts, modeling demonstrations, success criteria, concise communication, and logical sequencing. This directly addresses the comprehensive Proficient level requirements for content presentation, which specify that presentation of content consistently includes these elements with no irrelevant, confusing, or nonessential information. Weekly Spark helps teachers understand what constitutes essential information for their specific content and grade level, avoiding both information overload and insufficient detail.

**Instructional Plans** support helps teachers demonstrate internalization of plans from high-quality curriculum, create measurable and explicit objectives aligned to state standards, and design activities, materials, and assessments that build on prior student knowledge and provide appropriate time for student work and reflection. The Weekly Spark feature essentially serves as a thinking partner that helps teachers work through the planning process systematically, ensuring that each element of the plan serves the learning objectives and aligns with rubric expectations.

The key distinguishing features of Weekly Spark include its anticipatory nature, providing support before teachers encounter challenges rather than requiring them to seek help reactively. The feature provides timely, relevant support aligned to Louisiana pacing guides and standards, recognizing where teachers are in the curriculum sequence and what instructional demands are approaching. It respects the limited bandwidth of teachers managing multiple responsibilities, providing focused guidance rather than overwhelming options. All suggestions ground themselves in specific Louisiana Educator Rubric indicators and performance descriptors, helping teachers see the connection between daily instructional decisions and evaluation expectations.

### 8.2 Alignment Scorecard: Quality Assurance Through Rubric Analysis

The Alignment Scorecard performs comprehensive validation of teacher-created content against Louisiana standards and rubric expectations, serving as both a quality-keeper that prevents misaligned content from reaching students and a confidence-builder that helps teachers trust their instructional decisions. This feature addresses one of the most persistent challenges Louisiana teachers face: determining whether their instructional content actually meets the depth and rigor of state standards and whether it will demonstrate effective practice during evaluation observations.

The Scorecard validates content across multiple rubric indicators with particular emphasis on Planning domain descriptors. **Standards and Objectives** validation confirms that objectives are measurable, explicit, and aligned to state standards and high-quality instructional materials in both content and rigor. The Scorecard verifies that sub-objectives and prerequisite skills are aligned and logically sequenced to the lesson's major objective, matching the Proficient descriptor requirements. It checks whether learning objectives are displayed and referenced throughout the lesson with explanations, supporting teachers in reaching Exemplary practice. Rather than simply indicating that objectives are present, the Scorecard evaluates whether objectives communicate the full complexity and cognitive demand of the standards they address.

**Presenting Instructional Content** analysis verifies inclusion of all essential information with no irrelevant or confusing content. The Scorecard checks for logical sequencing and segmenting, examples and illustrations for new concepts, modeling demonstrations, and success criteria. This comprehensive review ensures teachers meet the detailed Proficient level requirements for content presentation. The analysis identifies information gaps that would leave students confused or unable to complete work successfully, redundant content that wastes instructional time, and sequencing issues that present complex ideas before establishing necessary foundations.

**Student Work** assessment ensures that assignments are aligned to the rigor and depth of standards and curriculum content. The Scorecard identifies whether assignments require students to interpret, analyze, synthesize, and evaluate information rather than merely reproduce it. It checks for alignment between the lesson objective and how assessment results will inform future instruction, addressing the Planning domain's Student Work indicator at the Proficient level. This analysis helps teachers understand the distinction between tasks that keep students busy and tasks that advance their understanding, a critical distinction that affects both student learning and evaluation ratings.

**Assessment** validation confirms that assessments align with standards depth and rigor, use a variety of question types to gauge learning and problem-solving, and measure student performance in multiple ways. The Scorecard verifies that assessments include performance checks and student reflection throughout the school year, matching Proficient descriptor requirements. It identifies gaps where cognitive demand mismatches standards expectations, such as standards requiring synthesis but assessments testing only recall, standards requiring application but assessments asking only for definition, or standards requiring analysis of multiple perspectives but assessments presenting only single viewpoints.

The distinguishing features of the Alignment Scorecard include its real-time validation of content quality against specific rubric descriptors, performed before content reaches students rather than after instruction has occurred. The Scorecard identifies pedagogical misalignments with specificity, explaining exactly what gap exists and why it matters for student learning and evaluation. It provides specific feedback citing rubric indicators and performance levels, using the same language that observers will use during evaluations. Perhaps most importantly, it builds educator confidence through transparent, standards-based quality assurance, helping teachers understand not just that their content meets expectations but why and how it meets them.

### 8.3 Delta Generator: Rubric-Aligned Differentiation

The Delta Generator provides sophisticated differentiation guidance based on Louisiana's official Accommodations and Modifications guide, maintaining grade-level standards access while providing appropriate supports as required by the rubric's emphasis on knowing and supporting all students. This feature addresses the persistent challenge of differentiating instruction effectively while maintaining rigor and alignment to grade-level standards.

The Delta Generator operationalizes the rubric's vision for differentiation, particularly within the Instruction domain's teacher knowledge and grouping indicators. **Teacher Knowledge of Students** practices demonstrate understanding of each student's anticipated learning abilities and needs. The Delta Generator helps teachers consistently provide differentiated supports and strategies to ensure students have the opportunity to master grade-level standards, directly addressing the Proficient descriptor. It guides teachers toward Exemplary practice by helping them incorporate student interests and backgrounds consistently across all differentiation decisions, moving beyond generic accommodations to personalized supports that build on students' existing knowledge and experiences.

**Grouping Students** support creates instructional grouping arrangements that maximize student understanding and learning efficiency. The Delta Generator helps teachers vary instructional group composition to best accomplish lesson goals, addressing the Proficient requirement. It provides guidance on setting clear expectations understood by students and ensuring each student takes responsibility for their individual role, tasks, and group work expectations, supporting meaningful and productive collaboration as described in Proficient and Exemplary descriptors. The feature helps teachers understand when whole-group instruction serves learning goals, when small-group instruction allows for more targeted support or extension, when pairs optimize peer learning, and when individual work builds independence and assessment readiness.

**Activities and Materials** differentiation ensures that content supports objectives, remains challenging, and elicits a variety of thinking across all student groups. The Delta Generator helps teachers provide activities that sustain students' attention, offer opportunities for student-to-student interaction, and include appropriate student choices aligned to learning objectives. This directly supports meeting the comprehensive Proficient level requirements while maintaining rigor across differentiated pathways. The feature ensures that modified activities maintain the cognitive demand and conceptual focus of the original task rather than simplifying to the point of losing alignment with the learning objective.

A critical distinction embedded throughout the Delta Generator is that differentiation maintains cognitive demand and standards alignment. The tool is designed with the understanding that differentiation does not mean watering down content but rather providing varied pathways to mastery of the same rigorous standards. This principle appears in every modification suggestion, ensuring teachers understand that meeting diverse student needs does not require lowering expectations. The feature helps teachers distinguish between accommodations that change how students access or demonstrate learning and modifications that change what students are expected to learn, with strong preference for accommodations that preserve grade-level expectations whenever possible.

The distinguishing features of the Delta Generator include its grounding in Louisiana's official guidance documents rather than generic differentiation strategies, ensuring that recommendations align with state expectations and approved practices. The feature differentiates based on pedagogically sound principles grounded in rubric descriptors, with explicit connections to how specific strategies support specific indicators. It ensures that modifications do not lower expectations but provide scaffolding to reach grade-level standards, preserving the rigor that evaluation systems expect. The tool cites specific rubric indicators when explaining differentiation approaches, helping teachers understand how their differentiation practices will be perceived during observations. Perhaps most importantly, it helps teachers move from implementing basic differentiation that meets Proficient expectations to sophisticated, student-centered adaptations that reach toward Exemplary practice.

### 8.4 Innovation Remix Engine: Cross-Disciplinary Synthesis With Rubric Integrity

The Innovation Remix Engine enables cross-disciplinary synthesis by translating instructional frameworks from one grade or subject to different contexts while maintaining quality and rubric alignment. This feature supports professional collaboration and peer learning without requiring the synchronous meetings that busy teachers often struggle to coordinate. It recognizes that excellent instructional practices often transfer across contexts when adapted appropriately, and it provides the structure to maintain quality during those adaptations.

The Innovation Remix Engine ensures that when frameworks are adapted across contexts, they maintain alignment with rubric expectations for both Planning and Instruction domains. **Student Work** alignment ensures that adapted assignments always maintain alignment to standards rigor and depth. The Remix Engine verifies that assignments require students to organize, interpret, analyze, synthesize, and evaluate information rather than merely reproduce it, even when translated to new contexts. It preserves the connection between what students are learning and their experiences, observations, and situations both inside and outside of school, as required by Exemplary descriptors. When a high-quality writing assignment designed for social studies is adapted for science content, the Remix Engine ensures that the analysis demands and synthesis expectations remain intact even as the specific content changes.

**Assessment** fidelity maintains alignment with standards depth and rigor across translations. The Remix Engine ensures that assessments continue to use a variety of question types, measure performance in multiple ways, and include extended written tasks as appropriate when adapted to new subjects or grade levels. This preserves the comprehensive Proficient level expectations even when the specific content changes. A robust mathematics assessment requiring students to explain their reasoning and justify solution paths should maintain those cognitive demands when adapted for different mathematical content, different grade levels, or even different subject areas where similar reasoning processes apply.

**Activities and Materials** translation ensures that content continues to support objectives, remains challenging, elicits variety of thinking, and provides time for reflection when moved to new contexts. The Remix Engine maintains the student-centered characteristics required by the rubric: activities that sustain attention, provide student-to-student interaction opportunities, evoke curiosity, and offer appropriate choices aligned to learning objectives. An engaging activity structure that works well for exploring historical perspectives should maintain its collaborative features and intellectual challenge when adapted for analyzing scientific data or literary themes.

**Instructional Plans** integrity confirms that when frameworks are remixed, they retain evidence of curriculum internalization, measurable and explicit objectives aligned to state standards, and activities that build on prior student knowledge and are relevant to students' lives. The Remix Engine ensures all Planning domain expectations transfer appropriately to the new context. This verification prevents the common problem where an activity that worked well in its original context loses coherence or purpose when transplanted without appropriate adaptation.

The distinguishing features of the Innovation Remix Engine include enabling peer learning across grade levels and subjects without compromising quality, allowing teachers to benefit from colleagues' innovations even when they teach different content. The feature maintains cognitive rigor during translation, explicitly checking that intellectual demands remain constant even as specific content changes. It preserves standards alignment in new contexts, verifying that the adapted framework addresses appropriate standards at appropriate levels. The Remix Engine supports professional collaboration without requiring synchronous meetings, respecting the reality that teachers rarely have common planning time across grade levels or departments. Perhaps most importantly, it helps teachers understand how rubric principles apply across different instructional contexts, building their capacity to identify and implement effective practices wherever they appear.

## 9. Technical Architecture and Implementation

### 9.1 Knowledge Base Structure and Organization

The foundation of Pelican AI's effectiveness rests on its comprehensive knowledge base of Louisiana-specific educational documents and frameworks. This knowledge base enables all four core features to provide accurate, contextually appropriate guidance rooted in Louisiana's vision for instructional excellence as articulated in official state documents and frameworks.

Core Louisiana documents incorporated into the knowledge base include Louisiana Student Standards organized by grade and subject area, providing the content foundation for all instructional guidance. The complete Louisiana Educator Rubric with all domain descriptors and performance level indicators supplies the evaluation framework that shapes feature design and feedback. The Louisiana Leader Rubric provides alignment with leadership expectations, ensuring that platform guidance supports the coherent system Louisiana has established. The Louisiana Educator Handbook offers procedural and policy context that helps teachers understand the broader professional expectations within which they operate. Louisiana-approved high-quality instructional materials pacing guides inform timing and sequencing suggestions, ensuring that platform recommendations align with the curriculum implementation timeline that Louisiana districts follow.

Knowledge organization structures this information strategically to support efficient retrieval and contextually appropriate responses. Louisiana standards are organized by grade level, subject area, and cognitive demand level to enable precise matching of content to expectations. When a teacher requests support for a specific grade and subject, the system retrieves only the relevant standards rather than overwhelming with comprehensive lists. Rubric indicators include performance level descriptors with specific examples at Exemplary, Proficient, and Unsatisfactory levels to support nuanced feedback. When the system provides feedback on instructional content, it can explain not just whether content meets expectations but what level of performance it represents and what specific changes would move it toward higher performance levels.

Differentiation strategies are mapped to specific student populations and rubric indicators, ensuring that recommendations maintain standards alignment while addressing diverse learner needs. The system understands which accommodations preserve grade-level expectations and which modifications might inadvertently lower standards, allowing it to guide teachers toward approaches that maximize learning for all students. Assessment types are mapped to cognitive demand and standards depth, enabling the system to identify misalignments between what standards require and what assessments actually measure. This mapping allows the Alignment Scorecard to provide specific feedback about gaps such as standards requiring analysis but assessments asking only for recall.

Query optimization ensures maximum efficiency and contextual appropriateness in system responses. Context-aware prompts automatically include relevant standards, rubric indicators, and grade level information without requiring teachers to specify these parameters repeatedly. Each feature has customized knowledge base retrieval that focuses on the most relevant rubric domains for its specific purpose. The Weekly Spark prioritizes Standards and Objectives, Motivating Students, and Lesson Structure and Pacing indicators, while the Alignment Scorecard emphasizes Planning domain indicators. Real-time validation checks against multiple knowledge sources simultaneously, catching potential misalignments before suggestions reach teachers. Feedback loops improve retrieval quality based on user satisfaction with suggestions over time, creating a system that becomes more accurate and helpful with continued use.

### 9.2 Prompt Engineering for Louisiana Context
